  <div class="post-content">
    
    <p>Fanfan hasn't come up to the tree house for a long time and her husband, Ankang, doesn't even know of its existence, since he never attended Willowcreek Academy. So when Fanfan's sweaty forehead and trembling fingers first emerge through the entrance and Ankang leaps out after her, looking around wide-eyed at shelves of books, cards, board games, and handhelds, Lily and I are quite dumbfounded. Fanfan creeps over to us and leans against the wall, fanning herself, saying,</p>
<p>"Oh my gosh, coming up here is still so scary!"</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>I set down my PS vita and look from Lily to her and to her husband's butt at the window. He spotted an electricity outlet and stuck his torso outside to follow the wires. He cranes his neck to look at the solar panels and the small but still overbuilt turbines at the treetop. I grin back at Fanfan,</p>
<p>"Maybe you're still too heavy---"</p>
<p>Both Lily and Fanfan slap my shoulder and back. Fanfan turns to Ankang,</p>
<p>"Ankang! Careful, you'll fall! Get the thing out already!"</p>
<p>"You guys <em>built</em> this?" His face is shining. He reseats his black-framed glasses and gestures around. Fanfan tuts and his hands plunge into his bag, rummaging as he says, "Wow, your school lets you do that? Here." He produces two neatly folded envelopes. Lily and I open them.</p>
<p>"Welcome to our wedding!" The gold letters at the top says on the red paper. Below that are their names. A drawing of them each holding a half of a couplet bearing blessings that incorporate their names takes up most of the space.</p>
<p>"Cute!" Lily beams. "Are you two finally holding one?"</p>
<p>"It's our parents," Ankang sits down. They registered four years ago and then went studying abroad. He sighs, "and relatives. I had hoped they'd forgotten..."</p>
<p>"Where's the venue?" I scan the invitation again.</p>
<p>"TBD? We aren't sending this out, yet, actually. But you know..."</p>
<p>"I just want you two to be the first to know!" Fanfan exclaims.</p>
<p>Lily claps her hands, radiant, and throws herself into Fanfan for a hug,</p>
<p>"Congrats! Excited? What about you?" She turns to Ankang. "Of course we're coming! I'm here if you need help!"</p>
<p>"Just don't make her the maid of honor." I snicker and find an empty frame. "Lily'll make it <em>her</em> wedding, then." The invitation fits perfectly. I put back the matboard and lock the back. Then I spray some detergent and wipe the glass clean. The elf-crafted frame is of a rustic style, but it glows warm on the wall in the Saturday sun.</p>
<center>

<p>Lily ends up being a bridesmaid. Fanfan teeters back and forth wondering if I should be the bridesman, since that isn't really a thing in China---but then again, what's the point of having both Lily and me up there? Besides, she wants me to be the cameraman.</p>
<p>"I can't charge you." I pull a face at her.</p>
<p>"And I can't really ask you for gift fees, either."</p>
<p>"A bag of wedding candy, then?"</p>
<p>"Deal!" Her eyes squeeze into two crescents.</p>
<p>Two days later, I receive a phone call. My hands are busy with pipettes and tubes. I wedge my phone between a shoulder and my tilted head and answer, "..."</p>
<p>Might be spam callers. You'll never know.</p>
<p>"Is this Liuy? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?"</p>
<p>"Who's this?"</p>
<p>"It's Ankang's father. You're Liuy, right?"</p>
<p>That's not what you can call me, but whatever. He gives me an address thirty minutes' drive away and tells me to go over. I apologize that I'm in the middle of an experiment, and it's part of a week-long procedure. He asks me whether I'm the cameraman. I reply yes. "Then come over, now." No, unless it's a matter of life and death. I lift my head, and my phone drops into my drawer with a <em>clang</em>.</p>
<p>Seconds later, it rings again. I wait until I finish pipetting before answering, "Hmm."</p>
<p>"Liuy?" It's Fanfan's mom. How the hell do they have my phone? "Liuy, can you come over, please?"</p>
<p>I just finished saying "sorry" before the lab door busts open. If it wasn't for the forehead and the dots on the tip of his nose, I wouldn't know it's Fanfan's dad. I can only assume it's Ankang's mother that's frogmarching me with him. How they got into the building and through two more keyed doors is beyond me. Their expressions kill my attempt to protest. I use my elven art to summon my phone into my pocket, and allow myself to be abducted.</p>
<p>The wedding needs to be grand and extravagant. It has to have flair. It must be talked about months later, and if people forget it, then there must be photos to remind them.</p>
<p>"Do you understand?" The four in-laws look down at me. I nod on my squeaky plastic stool. "Your parents would want the same."</p>
<p>"No, my mom won't." I mutter.</p>
<p>"Take this." Fanfan's dad sets down a bag in my lap. "You use my camera." My jaws drop. "Canon EOS 1DX Mark III." He says with pride. I promptly return it back into the bag. It's the final flagship full frame DSLR from Canon. I never even <em>heard of</em> anyone using it before. <em>I wanna rob this guy.</em> "You know how to use it, right?"</p>
<p>I definitely should rob him just for asking that.</p>
<p>"He means that we want you to document everything in the wedding. The preparations, the planning, the decorations, the rehearsal, the make-up before wedding, the wedding itself, and whatever is after." Ankang's mother says.</p>
<p>"What comes after?"</p>
<p>"You'll see. Then you leave."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"I'll be outside waiting for my camera. You take the SD card and send it back in two weeks." Fanfan's dad stares down the end of his nose at me.</p>
<p>I really should've charged an abhorrent amount and robbed him blind.</p>

<p>At 8:38 on Monday, Lily and I drive over to join Fanfan and the bridesmaids at the Airbnb the couple's parents rented. It's next to a beach, built from granite, mostly three stories tall except for its tower, and dominates view. I marvel at the battlements at the tower's crown. This used to be a wartime central command headquarters. The numerous windows now look into rooms no longer of generals or staff officers, but of the groomsmen, bridesmaids, and the families of the couple.</p>
<p>"Wow, Liuy!" A girl runs out and hugs me. Who the heck this is, acting so intimate? "You haven't changed at all! Other than the ponytail." I recognize her bright voice, and I get a good look at her delicate face. It's Xiaoqiao, Fanfan and my classmate from Willowcreek, and Fanfan's best friend.</p>
<p><em>...I like her old eyes better.</em> I think.</p>
<p>"I like the short hair better." She turns to Fanfan and Lily. "Neater. More energetic."</p>
<p>"See---"</p>
<p>"I've always said that---" The other two start in unison.</p>
<p>Fanfan has three bridesmaids. Other than Lily and Xiaoqiao, there's her friend from college and grad school, whose name I keep forgetting. The three of them sit in the back as I drive all four to the mall. Xiaoqiao braids my hair all the way.</p>
<p>My main job of documenting their hunt for the dream wedding gown and bridesmaid dresses ends as soon as we step into the first shop, when a polite staff sees my camera and points out the "no photography" sign on the door. The girls have other uses of me, anyways. They enter the fitting room with a stack of dresses. Then they come out and call me. I'm not sure where to look when I peel my eyes away from a tag on the clothes that says, "body: 100% cotton; shoulder padding: 90% cotton, 9% silk, 1% spandex".</p>
<p>"Well, which one's better?" Lily taps a foot.</p>
<p>"Uh? Um..." It's as if four suns are beaming at me.</p>
<p>"C'mon, look up! We're here!" Fanfan frowns.</p>
<p>"Look at how red his face is!" Her college friend laughs.</p>
<p>"Forget it. He'll pick whatever is on Lily anyways." Xiaoqiao pokes Lily.</p>
<p>"'Course. I got the best figure." Lily lifts her chin.</p>
<p>For the next five days, salesgirls in some stores make a point to walk by us. Some try to help me out, giggling, and give me pointers on how to choose based on material, cut, fit, style, and color. Other are here just for the laughs and teases. There's a guy waiting for his girlfriend next to me on the bench in one of the shops. When the girls come out and call me, his eyes nearly pop onto the floor. He mutters, "Damn, man. Life winner," when I got up. To make things worse, the girls sometimes come out wearing the same dresses as before but swap between themselves, or they grab different colors of the same dress and put on the same color one by one. The worst is when they stay in there for an eternity, whispering and giggling. This made me become very acquainted with info tags. Do you know that clothes with at least 1% spandex in them almost always have a stitch length of at least 3 mm and more loose threads?</p>
<p>Even so, every day when I set down their bags of dresses that have nothing to do with the wedding in the trunk, feet sore from walking and standing, arms aching from the bags, and face stiff from blushing---every day when they bade me goodbye after lunch as I set off with Ankang and the groomsmen, I can't help but feel warm inside: I'm a part of this, even if I can't do what I'm supposed to do.</p>
<p>Afternoons are much more chill. Though they're taking times off, Ankang and Fanfan still have to work from home on papers. Having done this the entire morning alone, Ankang is easily distracted once we're in my car. He and the groomsmen steer me into arcades, hobby stores, pubs, bookstores, game shops, pubs, electronic stores, pubs, and finally the mall---where we look at the time, look at each other, and go home. I must've visited all the pubs in the vicinity, and sampled all of their coconut water (all the same brand, though). Friday afternoon, Ankang looks around in the car before we leave, and says,</p>
<p>"Gang, we need to be serious. We have a deadline, and that comes in <em>five hours</em>."</p>
<p>Thus we set foot in the men's sections for the first time. Some are in the same store where the girls tried their dresses. I try to keep my head low, but a salesgirl still comes over cackling,</p>
<p>"Oh? Back for more?" She rifles through the seven black ties dangling on my one arm and three grey tux on my other. "Grey? For a wedding? What are you, 70-year-olds? Try red or sky blue or even light flax yellow."</p>
<p>We got back in two hours. Fanfan is taking out the trash. She walks over,</p>
<p>"That was quick. Got everything?"</p>
<p>"Yep." Ankang pats my shoulder, hard. "Liuy's the man!"</p>
<p>Lily gets in the car. I place my hands on the steering wheel, blink for three seconds, and take them off. I beckon to Lily and sigh,</p>
<p>"Here. You drive."</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>Saturday morning, Lily pokes her head out of her room at the sound of me leaving.</p>
<p>"Today, too?" She yawns.</p>
<p>"No rest for the wicked." I grunt. "Not you, though. Get back to bed."</p>
<p>Ankang's father is pacing up and down the parking lot when I pull up. Upon hearing my car, he turns and beckons the other three out from under the entryway. Fanfan's dad jumps into the shotgun with gusto and whips out a stack of paper covered in annotations and post-it notes. He turns to the others,</p>
<p>"The Sea Lark hotel first, then the Church of the Christ, Gabriel Modern, and finally the Butte Garden? Okay! I got the directions." He replaces my phone with his in the holder. "You got my camera? Let's go, then."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us go then, you and I,</p>
<p>When the morning is spread out against the sky</p>
<p>Like all the printed maps that submerge my dashboard;</p>
<p>Let us go, through predetermined streets,</p>
<p>and seek the retreats</p>
<p>where the couple can wed under the sun,</p>
<p>and feast with the guests inside once that's done:</p>
<p>Streets dead in slumber slowly coming alive</p>
<p>and would have worth the drive</p>
<p>Had there not been an incessant voice saying...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Told them to not worry about the price; there are four of us for that, after all." Fanfan's dad was talking about how Ankang and Fanfan spent a few weeks narrowing down their venue choices to four. "They do the listing and leave the rest to us---turn here... Their website mentioned an alley entry for their parking lot..."</p>
<p>The lobby is lit by natural light reflecting off of and refracting through the crystal chandeliers above. A thick, wide carpet leads us from the front door to the receptionist desk, and continues up the grand staircase. Tall granite and marble pillars stand on either side and lead the way to hallways. The parents exchange a string of jargons with the lobby manager and head down one of them. I hurry along, past prim and proper tourists and through a dining hall. The manager gestures like a royal aide as he tells us about the usual procession route, and demonstrates spots at the front, where the newly-wed and the parents would sit during the feast. Then he beckons us to follow him outside onto the porch. Ankang's mother leans over and whispers,</p>
<p>"Did you take all that down? Why aren't you taking pictures?"</p>
<p>I shake sleep out of my mind and snap multiple photos of the dining hall. Outside, Fanfan's mom is asking about the automatic canopy.</p>
<p>"Ah yes, yes, yes." The manager nods. "We don't advertise this, but yes, we have a canopy that deploys automatically before the rain. State-of-art weather detection. Connected to the weather station, too, for more accuracy." He presses a button on the wall. The top of the lamp posts on the porch extends upwards, and <em>poof</em>, tarps unfurl, covering the platform in a complete shade. I snap some photos. Fanfan's dad says to me,</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. Don't be stingy! Pressing that shutter doesn't cost money!"</p>
<p>That sums up the other venues, too. The four parents managed to trade jargons with managers or staffs at every location, and surprised them with one or two pieces of inside trivia: confirming the pastor secretly nicknamed "Father Fortune" would be available to host that day, inquiring if Monet's "Water Lilies" would be open to them, naming all the gardens at the Butte and then analyzing which would have the most plants in bloom in three weeks, etc. I took so many photos that I couldn't even remember what each venue looked like---and I'm supposed to be omniscient here.</p>
<p>At least they take me to dinner afterwards. In the busy chatter and the scent of food, my feet and legs throb with soreness. <em>This was more exhausting than the mall trips</em>, I think, working my way through the myriads of photos as I waited the parents to return from bathroom. A lot of the photos are designed to be stitched into panoramas. With the right program, I can explore the places again by zooming in and dragging on my screen. I go over the proposed procession routes and imagine the guests seating. <em>Right next to that pole is good for procession photos. Full view of the aisle. Or I can slip up from the side for some frontal shots. The Confessional has good views... I wonder if they'd let me keep a couple things in there for easy access...</em></p>
<p>"That looks amazing." Fanfan's mom sits down, eyes on the screen. "You've been working really hard, today, Liuy. Thank you."</p>
<p>"Fanfan has always helped me. It's the least I can do."</p>
<p>"Thanks." She smiles. I blush. She hands me the menu. "Pick whatever you fancy. Don't be shy. I expect a healthy young man like you to eat a lot! Oh, you're all back. Look at what he's doing! By the way, is this VR?"</p>
<p>"No... It's a panorama..." I blush harder.</p>
<p>"I didn't know you could do that. Wow." Ankang's mother drags around the photo. She opens the church one and gasps. "Oh my, you can even look up in here!"</p>
<p>"Good job!" Fanfan's dad gives my back a hearty pat. "You're sending these over, right?" I nod. Ankang's father leans closer,</p>
<p>"Is it me, or are the colors off?" He squints. The others gather around.</p>
<p>"The colors pop a little too much." Ankang's mother says.</p>
<p>"The greens look a bit more like blue, too." Ankang's father adds.</p>
<p>I hastily reset the saturation and the color balance.</p>
<p>"Say... you're not colorblind, too, are you?" Fanfan's dad asks.</p>
<center>
#
</center>
<p>I park my car at 8:38 the following Monday. The wedding families are all outside. Fanfan is screaming,</p>
<p>"Of course I know he's---"</p>
<p>"And you still asked him?" Ankang's father cuts across her.</p>
<p>"We don't care, dad---" Ankang retorts.</p>
<p>"Don't you? You don't care how he will take photos and process them?" Fanfan's dad asks.</p>
<p>"We're <em>thirty</em>! Can't we make our own decisions?" His daughter jabs a finger at him. "<em>You</em> are colorblind, too!"</p>
<p>"And I only do <em>black and white</em>! Do you want your wedding photos to look like funeral photos?"</p>
<p>"Hey, that's---" Fanfan's mom steps in. He raises a hand.</p>
<p>"<em>No.</em> I am colorblind myself, and that's why I know <em>exactly</em> how it's like. I don't care whether he has twenty years of experience or he worked for a black-and-white newspaper or the public relations of his college. He won't do. A no is a no, and that's <em>my</em> camera, too."</p>
<p>"He has his own camera." Ankang sulks. His father tuts like a whip cracking.</p>
<p>"<em>Why won't you just listen?</em> From a biological standpoint---"</p>
<p>"You just gonna sit through this?" Lily scowls and shakes my arm.</p>
<p>"I already quit." I stick my head out and grumble to the ground. Lily's hand slips down. Ankang's furrowing eyebrows unfurl and disappear into his bangs. Fanfan---I can't see her face. She strides into the mansion, trembling. Her mom throws me an apologetic glance, and follows her.</p>
<p>"I'm---"</p>
<p>I lunge over and clasp Lily's mouth tight.</p>
<p>"You are not quitting. I've made her cry already. You are not making her cry more." I hiss.</p>
<center>
#
</center>
<p>I kick open the lab door with my foot a little harder than usual. There's nothing I can help with now, I tell myself; I lost nothing, really. I had fun, saw some cool places, and even made them shell out for my A5 Wagyu steak that night. Besides, I was never happy with how they interrupted my research. Somebody has to keep Lily's work going, too.</p>
<p>For the first time in years, I am home alone. No more hustle and bustle in the kitchen right after coming back. I slump low on the couch, swiping my phone with an absentminded finger, and listen to the rice cooker bubbling away the ticking of the clock. Only after rejecting one or two calls from those parents or opening a message just to close it and get rid of the annoying notification dot do I get up to reheat a pot of ribs. This lasts through two dinners and two lunches before ending up as the greasy base broth for noodles and some bak choy leaves.</p>
<p>I never realized how loud the clock ticks, or the fridge hums. I put on my headphones to block them, turning up the music a notch higher than I'm used to, but nothing fits my mood. I pull over a book but my mind refuses to register any words. Every evening, I stare at the same spot on the page or the ceiling, until light floods the driveway and I either walk or support a swaying Lily into the house.</p>
<p>"They want you to---" She starts one day.</p>
<p>"Wow, you got lighter." I smirk and lay her down on the couch. She snarls and flips over, and swings her leg backwards to kick my butt. On some days I do let her go on, and let the words flow through my body, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>One afternoon, having wiped the wrong side of a microscopy slide and swept two days of effort down the drain, I leave lab early. It's a clear and warm day. I decide to wander around in the Willowcreek Academy. Class ends at 3:15, and I have to dodge and weave through younger kids and older teenagers just to cross the yard in front of the Chapel. Its marble dome atop the red-brick rotunda is under maintenance. The hammering and grinding kill my idea of using the practice rooms. The black stone fountain in the middle of the yard is surrounded by students from elementary, middle, and high school divisions. Among them is a pale memory of myself, laughing and glistening in the sun. I walk on, down the path between the trees, past the garden (scattered with high school and college couples, and more pale shadows from my memory), and deeper into the woods. I turn right and go off the path at a gnarly oak. Past two white birch trees comes a ripple in the air. This is the ward we set up after the youngest of us graduated.</p>
<p>I look up at a tall, stout oak. It's a miracle that its sprawling branches can form such a perfect niche for our tree house. Bright green leaves frame the six light brown walls of the cabin, and leave some space for the slanted red roof. Thick branches reach out under and around it, and hold up a balcony, some platforms and gangways to a second story, and the second story cabin itself. We had to nail the rope ladder to the trunk the autumn it was built, because the wind made it impossible for some of us (me) to climb. then we added a wide semi-circular fence around the top half to make some of us (Fanfan) feel safer. Lily never cared about the ladder, or cared for it. She scales the trunk and flips in through the windows just fine.</p>
<p>My eyes sweep over all the upgrades we installed: April showers made us add a pop-up canvas canopy over every window; summer heat motivated us to add the solar panels so we could use a ceiling fan; autumn gales inspired a weather vane and some small turbines for more energy; finally, early winter nights brought about the second story---from where the views of sunsets are gorgeous---and a telescope, as well as portable heaters.</p>
<p>I follow another pale memory up. The tree house seems roomier, even with all the beanbags, bookshelves, mini fridge, video games, board games, cards, and toolboxes on the floor (I think Likai forgot his yo-yo here), and posters, photos, and painting on the walls. I avert my eyes from the newest addition that the sun is slinking off of, and find myself taking it down.</p>

<p>Lily tells me they're doing wedding photos now, and every day they have to go around and sometimes out of the city for the "perfect shot". I started driving Lily over again after having to carry her out of the car for three nights.</p>
<p>It's a new moon tonight, and the sky is splattered with clouds. The tide is coming in, and the wind lifts the waves too high. Lights flash on the shrinking beach, and I hear echoes of instructions, too. Yuki Kajiura's crystalline notes prance around inside the car. I don't know about the wedding gown, but none of their other wedding outfits includes a jacket.</p>
<p><em>Lily is immune to colds. That's a relief.</em></p>
<p>I must've dozed off, or I wouldn't have jolted when Ankang knocked on the window. He flings himself into the shotgun seat and breathes out, "<em>Brrr.</em>"</p>
<p>I frown and raise a brow. He plugs in his phone and clamps it to my dashboard. The map app commands me to turn right onto the street. Ankang buckles up and shivers,</p>
<p>"Hooo... six pa-packs." He juts a thumb at the back, teeth clattering. I turn and see the coconut water he meant. He turns up the AC. "L-let's go, m-man!"</p>
<p>This part of the city is quite curious. Old buildings are being torn down to make way for the new, or getting renovated so new structures can be built on top. Some lucky ones are preserved, and they squat between the new: seedy old wooden storefronts buried among steel, concrete, and granite, like eroded seashells in the sand.</p>
<p>The pub we arrive at is one such shell. Its sign sways in the night air, too dim to read. Its large windows yellow, creaking on occasional gusts. Its bouncer is nonexistent---why would it need one, anyways? This is the one pub we didn't visit during the first week. A sign on the door informs me it only opens 9-2. With a gleeful sigh of relief, Ankang holds the door for me. Hanging light in the shape of gas lamps throw an orange glow around the red wooded walls and floors. Yellowed clippings behind non-glare glasses and frames tell me the milestones of this world, this city, and this pub. Bartenders methodically fill up glasses, and then juggle cocktail shakers with ease. Slow jazz oozes from a corner, warmer than Lily's smile in the laziest summer afternoon. My shoulders relax.</p>
<p>People both young and old drink at their tables and at the bar. A couple of them laugh at a joke, and then fall back into a hearty murmur. The tables are lacquered, gleaming, and squeaky clean. A barmaid dressed more like a barista comes over.</p>
<p>"The usual?"</p>
<p>"I defer to him." Ankang lays his head on his hands on the table, drained.</p>
<p>"Tsingtao for him. I have my own." I pull a can of coconut water out of thin air.</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir." She points at a sign about no outside drinks. So I pull out a pen and write on the napkin: "But for you, I'll make an exception." She smiles. "Anything to eat?"</p>
<p>"Ramen?" I ask Ankang. He nods. "And macrons, please."</p>
<p>The street outside is empty. A lot of the buildings are dark. Maybe that'll change in a couple years. Food and drinks come. Ankang slurps the noodle and gulps down beer. He reaches for one of my macrons (I resist slapping his wrist) and sighs,</p>
<p>"Oh my god, <em>now</em> I'm alive!" He prods the beer, "You want some? This stuff is divine! Yifan took me to the beer festival you guys have, and this tastes just like beers there. I mean, I <em>can</em> buy them elsewhere but they taste different."</p>
<p>"Different factories. This 'divine stuff' is what my mom drinks out of plastic bags."</p>
<p>"Yeah yeah yeah! I did that, too!" <em>Slurp.</em> "My god, I'm spent." <em>Gulp.</em> "Can you believe them? Twelve degrees out there and they kept changing formations? It's---" <em>Slurp.</em> "---the same at every place we go."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh." I munch on a macron, thinking about how exhausted Lily is every night, and she is hardier than most.</p>
<p>"Four takes on a fucking photo that probably won't make it, just because someone's shoe is sticking out, or a bridesmaid's hair fluttered, or they blinked at the shutter---and those were at least logical. Wait 'til---oh what am I saying, they're <em>parents</em>. They make every damn thing logical!" He clears his throat, and imitates his father, "'From an aesthetics standpoint, you want to line people from tallest to shortest.'"</p>
<p>"And skew the weight of the photo to one side. You know someone's going to bullshit when they start like that."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. 'From a physics standpoint---'"</p>
<p>"'From a management standpoint---'"</p>
<p>"'From a macro standpoint---'"</p>
<p>"'From a biological standpoint---'" I smirk.</p>
<p>"Such tosh." Ankang shakes his head. "And they won't take it any other way no matter what we say that day. Excuse me!" He waves for the barmaid.</p>
<p>"Next can's on you."</p>
<p>"A bottle---"</p>
<p>"'<em>Can</em>'."</p>
<p>"Fine." His face falls. Beer arrives. He cracks it open and nurses it. The patrons come and go. Under the soothing light the empty ramen bowl and chopsticks are taken away. The jazz band churns out one piece after the next. Ankang stares at my finger, tapping away the beats.</p>
<p>"I can see why Yifan and you are so close." He looks up, smiling. "Others would tell me to calm down."</p>
<p>"She used to do that."</p>
<p>"She says it'll make you angrier if she was angry, too. It won't make you feel any better."</p>
<p>"Still drives me crazy. Why take the other's side?"</p>
<p>"<em>That's</em> why you were always angry with her." He chuckles. "But you learned..."</p>
<p>"...that she really does care." I shrug.</p>
<p>"Oh come on. She always does. She calls you family!" He holds up a fist. "And so do I."</p>
<p>"Takes a type to like me." I bump it. "And to not mind how close we are."</p>
<p>"Mind? <em>I</em> am the one she married, after all." He laughs.</p>
<p>"Oh, fuck off."</p>
<p>"You two are getting along." Lily collapses next to Ankang, now out of her bridesmaid dress. "Good job. Haven't seen him crack a smile since he quit."</p>
<p>"<em>Liuy</em>!" Fanfan sits down next to me and grabs my shoulder. "I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"</p>
<p>"It wasn't your fault I quit." I mutter and look away.</p>
<p>"Oh, when you left, we had more fights with mom and dad. It went on for days, and I even threatened to cancel the wedding---that made them call you. They hoped to have you back. But when you just hung up over and over---!"</p>
<p>"Eh." I grunt at the table.</p>
<p>"I felt so guilty---I wanted you to be with us but I ended up getting you hurt. I said to Sun Ankang---I said you haven't been like this for years! How do I even fix this? We thought for so long and he said in the end to leave it to him. I'm glad it worked out!" She grips my shoulder, hard. "<em>Don't</em> do that again, okay? At least talk to me. I <em>promised</em> I'd always be on your side, alright?"</p>
<p>"<em>We</em>, Liuy. She meant <em>we</em>." Ankang says in earnest.</p>
<p>"Unless I block you. Yeah." I glance at Lily, who returns a tired and knowing look. I take a deep breath. "It's my fault. You know it's my fault. I'm too self-centered as always. I did promise to not ignore messages..." Fanfan sniffs. Alarmed, I grab a napkin. "No, wait--- Ayaa Fanfan I'm sorry!" There's nothing I can do to stem her sobs. Lily smirks with schadenfreude. "Hey, listen..." I grit my teeth and whispers. "I'm more scared of losing you than you're of losing me, okay?" My cheeks burn. "Who do I complain to about Lily if we're over?" Fanfan sobs harder and squeezes me. "Okay. Um... Have you any dinner yet? Ankang had two beers, a bowl of ramen, and macrons. Do you want anything?"</p>
<p>"Ramen? Macrons? I thought this was a pub." Lily sits up and calls, "Menu, please!"</p>
<p>Fanfan lets go of me and frowns at her hands. I take a new piece of napkin to wipe her face clean. Dark streaks of eyeliners smear with whatever else she put on for the photoshoot. I tilt my head and blow out my cheeks,</p>
<p>"Oh... your eyes got smaller with these off..."</p>
<p>She slaps my hand and snorts. I wipe her nose. She looks up at Ankang.</p>
<p>"I had enough." She sniffs. "I was excited at first, even though we were doing it so late. But it has become something different entirely."</p>
<p>"It has always been something else from the start, and yeah, I've indulged in the sunken cost fallacy for long enough." Ankang replies.</p>
<p>"Whatever you're thinking, I'm in." Lily says.</p>
<p>"Me, too." I say.</p>

</center>
<p>A week later, two motorcycles and three SUVs gather at a parking lot two blocks away from the grand hotel for Fanfan and Ankang's wedding. I dropped Lily off at 7:28. Ankang's mother ushered her in, leaving Fanfan's mom outside to wait for others. She fidgeted about, clacking her heels on the pavement, and managed to give me a quick smile and nod when I caught her eye.</p>
<p>The sky is cloudless. A bright spring sun beams down on us. I sit on the curb massaging my clammy hands that refuse to warm up, and watch Likai and "Old Guy" Jiao Yiran chain-swear at each other while they play cards on the grass. We exchange a jibe here and there. Old Bi fiddles with his phone near his bike. Bro Neng takes out the guns strapped to his bike, checking down the barrel and glaring down the sight. He cocks one and mimes a shot at me, smirking in a Crayon Shin-Chan's doofus voice,</p>
<p>"Oh ho ho, I'm gonna see Xiaoqiao again..."</p>
<p>"Aren't you married already?" I pull a face.</p>
<p>"But Xiaoqiao is Xiaoqiao."</p>
<p>"Xiaoqiao, oh ho ho." Old Bi chortles and imitates him. Likai and Old Guy guffaw and follow suit. I chuckle, too, breathing easier. These guys are worth all the trouble of tracking them down, arranging for their travels, and all the back and forth with the communications. I'm grateful that no one really gave me a hard time when I approached them. Old Bi agreed without even blinking. He stands up and pockets his phone. "Alright, let's do one last check up."</p>
<p>Gas is full. The huge front fenders Old Bi bolted to our cars are secure. To make up for the extra weight, he upgraded our suspension and lifted the front, and swapped out our engines. For Likai's and my cars, he also wielded the differentials to make them real all-wheel drive. I eye the button next to the traction control with apprehension. One press and no more rev limiter. It's all the way to the red line, putting 500 horsepower to our shiny new tires before the next gear.</p>
<p>They should be starting now. The bridesmaids and groomsmen walk in pairs through the archway adorned with balloons, down the wide red velvet carpet under the crisscrossing streamers, and up to the giant golden backdrop bearing the same drawing from the invitation. The groomsmen in their skyblue tuxedos are energetic and refreshing to look at. The makeups on the bridesmaids are a fine touch. Xiaoqiao is radiant. Lily is breathtaking. The other bridesmaids are also beautiful. They pass the many families and friends on either side, holding a bouquet. The hems of their red dresses flutter in their wake over rose petals on the carpet. It's not the lacy lavender dress with layered frills they decided in the first week---oh I wonder why---but it still draws gasps and sighs. Phones are out, and they are fervently snapping and recording. The thousand-dollar professional wedding photographer walk a few paces before them at the edge of the carpet, walking backwards to take his shots. Then he runs down to the arch to repeat.</p>
<p>Ankang steps onto the carpet with his mother. His hair is neatly combed. His navy suit is sleek, every fold is where it should be. His steps are firm, calculated, and quiet. He bows occasionally to greet guests here and there, bestowing them with polite smiles. His mother's face blooms like years ago it had on her own wedding.</p>
<p>Our phones ring. That's from our friends among the guests. Old Bi and Bro Neng don their helmets. Likai, Old Guy, and I start our engines.</p>
<p>At last, Lily lets out a soft gasp beside Xiaoqiao. Fanfan materializes under the archway, arm-in-arm with her dad. Her hair is tied in a bun, held in place by a sapphire-studded gold hair pin. Behind her left ear is a round ruby hair clip, the shape of a stylization of her name. Light eye liners made her eyes appear wider (haha). She smiles meekly down at the carpet. Her white gown weaves a full lace collar around her neck and shoulder. From there it flows down and trails long behind her. Her gloved hands hold up the front hem of her gown, high enough so she won't trip but low enough to hide her shoes. She walks with steps so delicate as if she is aloft and her dad is guiding her through the air.</p>
<p>You want to see an angel? Get jealous. She's married.</p>
<p>She stumbles. The crowd gasps. In the parking lot, our phones ring again. Bro Neng looks at us through his skull face visor and nods. He gestures briskly.</p>
<p>We move out. Fanfan regains her balance and smiles up at Ankang at the front, defiant, and then at Lily and Xiaoqiao.</p>
<p>One block away, we remove our rev limiters. The abrupt roar from my car, Thunder, sends a sense of liberation down my spine. Old Bi and Bro Neng race down the empty street towards the square at the end. There, two banners that say "Celebrate the marriage of Mr. Sun Ankang and Ms. Sun Yifan" hang from giant balloons. They mark our entrance.</p>
<p>Old Guy's CR-V whizzes past me. Likai's black Rav 4 and my white one flank his rear. Old Bi and Bro Neng shoot straight into the glass door. I dig my nails into the steering wheel and shiver.</p>
<p>Inside, the MC asks Ankang if he would take Fanfan as his wife.</p>
<p><em>SMASH.</em> Old Bi and Bro Neng fly under the balloon arch and plant their wheels right in front of the microphone stands.</p>
<p>"Dope." Ankang says.</p>
<p>The parents and the MC look from the bikers to Ankang, and then at each other. I don't know what goes through her mind, but the MC decides to do what she does best,</p>
<p>"Ms.-Ms. Sun Yifan---" She says to the silent room. The crowd look from her to the bikers---even our friends, who are kept in the dark about the plan and are only instructed to send messages on the right cues---not sure who to ignore. Then, we are in. Old Guy blasts his CR-V through the remnant of the glass doors, does a 180, and skids to a halt in the middle of walkway. Likai side-smashes through the wall right behind him. His well-calculated trajectory ends right beside the Old Guy. I'm supposed to land on Old Guy's other side. But somehow I ram down the arch in mid-air, pop half of the silver and gold balloons, bring down the streamers, and spin out a donut upon landing, ripping up whatever is left of the carpet and stopping closer to the bikers than I wanted. I wasn't showing off; I hit a bump and Thunder's stiff suspension sent it flying. I hear Old Guy slapping his steering wheel and yelling,</p>
<p>"Yeah! Fuck yeah! Drifting! Whoo!!"</p>
<p>The crowd explodes, diving for cover as bits of brick, glass, wood, concrete, rubber, and metal wires pelt at them. We are prepared. Lily and Old Bi's elven arts shield them from all. The debris hit their invisible barriers and bounce back to pile behind the destroyed archway. Still, chairs and table scrape on the floor, slamming against fallen plates, cups, chopsticks, and bouquets. People scream, slipping on wedding candies as they attempt to climb over each other, one foot in the napkin basket, for the exit. Children bawl. Old uncles boss around. Old aunties curse at each other for priority to escape. The bridesmaids who aren't in on our secret cower and huddle. The groomsmen hurry over to try and save the day. Lily and Xiaoqiao kick off their heels and leap off to a side. Lily summons their sneakers. Ankang throws off his suit and holds out his arm wide around Fanfan to prevent anyone from getting to her. The MC seems to be someone who has seen a lot. She steadies herself and caws into the microphone, despite the menacing skull helmet of Bro Neng staring at her,</p>
<p>"Someone, call the police! Someone---" She prods at her phone, not knowing Old Bi has a signal jammer in his bike. She looks up for a landline, and gasps, "Ms.---<em>What are you doing?</em>"</p>
<p>In the utter chaos, Fanfan rips off her wedding dress. Underneath are her regular shirt and jeans and sneakers.</p>
<p>"What does it look like?" The microphone picks up her voice.</p>
<p>"The bride's running away!" Somebody's uncle points and yells.</p>
<p>The guests allow for two long seconds of silence for everyone to register what he meant and look to the stage. Likai barks out of his window,</p>
<p>"Who the hell asked you?"</p>
<p>The chaos ensues. People near the stage scramble to stop Fanfan. Old Bi and Bro Neng rev their bikes. The guests stop and glare at them, tentative, for an opening. Ankang staves their parents off of Fanfan, who throws her gown over the parents' heads. The MC tries to grab them, but Lily and Xiaoqiao bump into her on their way to join the bride and the groom. She stumbles headfirst into the oncoming groomsmen. A middle-aged woman slips through fallen tables and stomps toward the couple. Fanfan hurls her bouquet into her face and sends her packing. The four of them push past Old Bi. Bro Neng pulls out two guns and Fanfan takes one. She asks him if they're loaded, but he's too busy going,</p>
<p>"Xiaoqiao~~ You're sooo goooorgeous~~!" in Shin-chan's voice, to which Xiaoqiao responds,</p>
<p>"Ew, Han Yining, fuck off!" and bats his hand away.</p>
<p>Fanfan stuffs her gun to Ankang and smacks Bro Neng's shoulder,</p>
<p>"<em>Are they loaded??</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am! Yes yes yes!"</p>
<p>She wrenches the other gun out of his hand and leaps out from behind his bike. She fires at the nearest dude reaching for her. A powerful pellet of water smacks him back down. Some see this and shrink back, but others shrug it off as a sign of no real danger and advance. Down they go by shots from Ankang. Bro Neng rolls his bike forward to cover their rear. Lily leads Xiaoqiao behind the couple, and gears herself up with another water rifle.</p>
<p>I unlock my doors and get out to help them. People see me as a liability and scramble over to take over my car. I bash them back with my door and pull out a water rifle from under my seat. It becomes physical very soon. I hold the rifle before me to keep their snarling faces at bay. Damn, it's just a wedding, alright?</p>
<p>Lily knocks them back for me with the butt of her rifle.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you stay in the car, you idiot?" She seethes at me. "Xiaoqiao! Get in!" She then kicks off, a storm of sleek black hair dancing around the car, fending off the relatives and guests, shooting and batting them away so Ankang can get to the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Up at the front, the four parents finally untangle themselves with aid from the groomsmen, the remaining bridesmaids, and the MC. Fanfan's dad grabs the microphone and clears his throat. Sharp feedback pierces the air. Everyone recoils. Fanfan's dad shuts the microphone off and roars,</p>
<p>"STOP!"</p>
<p>"NO!" Fanfan shrieks back. "I'm leaving!" She jumps onto my engine hood and up to the roof. "<em>I've had enough!</em>"</p>
<p>"We, honey! We!" Ankang whispers up at her.</p>
<p>For a couple of seconds, their parents and Fanfan glare at each other, heaving. Ankang's father is the first to come to. He scowls and yells, pointing at me,</p>
<p>"Is this still about him? We've---"</p>
<p>"No, it is not!" Fanfan screams back. "It's about me! And Ankang! And everything that happened--everything that went wrong! <em>Everything</em>---because of <em>you</em>! From making Liuy quit to the hellish schedule of rehearsals and errands, to the outdated outfits and decorations, to this lackluster venue and music, to a whole bunch of people that either we haven't heard from for over a decade or have nothing to do with!" She jabs a finger at each word, "<em>Your</em> schedules! <em>Your</em> choices! <em>Your</em> colleagues, friends, and bosses!</p>
<p>"We didn't ask for any of this. We don't <em>want</em> any of this. <em>You</em> promised to leave everything to us and support whatever we decide, and end up controlling everything like we don't know better---as if we are still little kids!"</p>
<p>"Yifan. Yifan, calm down." Ankang's mother holds up her hand. "Calm down, okay? We just want this to be perfect---"</p>
<p>"Perfect? How? By dismantling everything we decided upon without discussing with us? By disregarding <em>our</em> work schedules and manipulating us to go along with <em>your</em> crap?" I can count on one hand the times I heard her swear. "Who are you trying to make this perfect for, anyways?"</p>
<p>"Is that how you speak to your parents?" A woman yells.</p>
<p>"How ungrateful!" A man bellows.</p>
<p>"SHUT UP!" Old Guy Jiao points out of his window. "FUCK YOU! AND YOU!" Then he juts his short chin at another one who inhales as though to say something, "AND YOU, TOO!"</p>
<p>"How many of you are actually here to celebrate Ankang and me? How many of you thought it was such a pain to drive over and to pay the gift fee, and wouldn't be here if it wasn't to save face? And how many of you are here to see your daughter as a bridesmaid or your son as a groomsman so you can boast we're close? And how many of you are here to see <em>me</em> in a dress and are pumping for the wedding riot?" A couple people lower their heads and exchange a smirk. Fanfan flings her rifle at them. "This isn't our wedding. It's a performance! You think I'm an easy target? Well," she flicks her middle fingers, "fuck you! This is not what we wanted. Find your entertainment elsewhere, or nowhere at all!"</p>
<p>I would've whistled, but Fanfan leaps off Thunder, and Ankang and I catch her just in case. She shoves us off and glares,</p>
<p>"Get in!"</p>
<p>Lily, who snuck into the car earlier without me noticing, pulls me into the backseat. Ankang scrambles into the driver's seat. Fanfan slams my door shut and slaps his butt,</p>
<p>"Move over!"</p>
<p>"Y-yes, ma'am!" He clambers over the shift stick.</p>
<p>Fanfan gets in and slams on gas. Thunder roars in delight. She pulls the handbrake just in time. The guests closest to us stuff their ears as the wheels screech through the velvet and kick up sparks. She floors the pedal. The engine makes a noise I've never heard before and we jolt forward, narrowly missing Likai and Old Guy, past the line of rubble and the butchered balloon arch, through the hole we made, and out under the clear, blue sky.</p>
<p>The last thing I see as I look back are the thunderstruck faces of the parents---Fanfan's mom looks half teary and half relieved---and rubble flying back in place under Lily's influence. Some of our friends in the crowd are making for Likai's and Old Guy's car to get away, too. The bikers ride for the exit. Old Bi takes his opportunity to stoop and grab a bag of wedding candy.</p>

<p>Thunder thunders down the street and up the highway. Cars drop behind us one by one until we are the only left. Ankang lets go of the door handle and his seat and sighs. He sinks into the seat and presses the stereo. <em>Departure</em> from the EGOIST floats out. The whistle from the turbo quiets down. I look out of the window. The sea is calm today.</p>
<p>"Sun Yifan, I thought you didn't have your license yet!" Xiaoqiao says.</p>
<p>"Still drives better than Liuy," Lily holds onto Xiaoqiao's arm and wiggles. "And he's actually an 8 out of 10."</p>
<p>"We must be the first couple to run away from our own wedding." Ankang says.</p>
<p>"The first to crash your own, more like." I reply.</p>
<p>"It was crazy." Xiaoqiao says. "You guys crashing through the wall was wicked! Even though I knew beforehand, but still."</p>
<p>"Don't forget the bride gunning down the relative---" Lily says.</p>
<p>"And the bride screaming on top of the car---" Xiaoqiao follows.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you told them, alright, Fanfan."</p>
<p>"And her jumping down---oh, and you kicking people's ass everywhere, Lily." Xiaoqiao pats Lily's head, and they both squint from me to Ankang.</p>
<p>"The bride did everything, even driving the getaway car." Lily smirks. "It's almost like all you boys' job was busting in."</p>
<p>"Whatever." I roll my eyes.</p>
<p>"Come on now." Xiaoqiao laughs.</p>
<p>Ankang sighs again from the shotgun.</p>
<p>"Too much excitement for me already..." He rubs his eyes and glances at Fanfan, "You need water? No? Tell me if you do..." He slides lower and shuts his eyes.</p>
<p>Lily starts crooning along the music. Her velvety voice blends with the sunlight streaming into the car, and melts through our minds. The images of rubble, bridesmaids and groomsmen cowering on the stage, relatives rushing and clawing at Ankang and Fanfan, those people's snarling faces over the water rifle, and Fanfan on the car roof, too: little by little they dissolve in Lily's voice. Ankang's chin is tucked in, his breath slow. I hear a shuffle from my right. Xiaoqiao produces a neck pillow and closes her eyes. Lily leans against her, effortlessly breathing out the lyrics. It wasn't long before Xiaoqiao goes out. Lily feels for my fingers, and hums with a satisfied grin. Our hands aren't clammy anymore.</p>
<p>The blue outside expands so far that it looks as if the sky is a waterfall that feeds into it. Waves skim its surface, almost invisible. Seagulls floating on the waves take off when we passed. Some glide along; others soar high above and circle overhead. One or two spiral down, dip their beaks in water, and back up they go. We sail together, a white car and the white birds.</p>
<p>"Getting comfortable with driving?" I lean forward and rest my chin on top of the seat back.</p>
<p>"How am I doing?" Fanfan asks.</p>
<p>"Didn't you hear Lily?"</p>
<p>"No." She tuts.</p>
<p>"Better than an 8 outta 10. But you did hear her sing earlier?"</p>
<p>Fanfan nods. I giggle. Her scent wafts over with the music. For a few bars, it feels like we are back in school: I tease her about her forehead, or her eyes, or the two symmetric dots on her nose, and she bites back about my long face, and then I ask her for snacks, because breakfast was a bread roll four hours ago; I lift a pen out of her pencil bag and we try to figure out whether its cap is yellow or green, and we grab Mayor Yang "Big Eyes" for a third (colorblind) opinion; I get a slip after checkup telling me biology is not possible because of my colorblindness, and she notices something is wrong and sits over to check in on me, even though it's the evening quiet studies and a patrolling teacher is standing right before us. I close my eyes and take a deep sigh.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Liuy." She says.</p>
<p>"It's the least I can do."</p>
<p>Fanfan tilts her head and bumps mine.</p>
<p>"Where are we going? Willowcreek?" I ask.</p>
<p>"Don't know..."</p>
<p>"Well, your call. Just find a rest area when fatigue kicks in, alright?" I murmur. My seat belt reels me back into the seat. Fanfan will be fine. After all, she's been guiding me for years. "But for now, please guide me awhile longer."</p>
