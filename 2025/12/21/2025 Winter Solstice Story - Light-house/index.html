  <div class="post-content">
    
    <p>Max gives a start at the sound of a knock. There is his friend, Landon, from next door in his swept-back red hair, pressing his large and hooked nose against the window. Landon draws back for Max to climb out onto the lower roof, and treats him to his signature toothy grin.</p>
<p>"Good evening. What's up?" Max rolls up his collar in the October nip. "Do you need help with homework? The physics one is gross, not gonna lie."</p>
<p>"Aww phooey, homework. Max, I gave up on physics today." Landon waves a hand.</p>
<p>"But- but the exam is---"</p>
<p>"Forget about the exam; you sound like my mom. C'mere, buddy. I have something to show you..."</p>
<p>Landon grins again and pats down Max's wavy hair. Together they hop over to his side of the roof. Landon pulls out of his open window something covered by a piece of cloth. Max raises a brow. Landon sets it down and whips off the cloth with a flourish.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>It's a model house made out of plexiglass on a wooden base. Its front door is complete with hinges fashioned from wires and knobs from clipped sewing pins. The windows look like they can slide up and down in tracks formed by two thinner layers of plexiglass. The exterior is lined with shallow grooves that mimic brick walls. Along each corner are quoins: small pieces of more plexiglass---sanded and painted white---of alternating sizes stacking over each other. Long strips of frosted plexi layer over one and another on top of narrow beams of popsicle sticks and serve as an angled roof. Out from one side is a dormer, and the other, a chimney, both grooved as well. Inside, stairs wind up along the walls to a small platform that reaches out to the side of a light bulb, against which leans a Lego figure in a sea captain's cap.</p>
<p>"Can I---?" Max finds his voice, quivering from excitement and awe as well as the chilly autumn evening. He motions at the door and windows. Landon's grin broadens and nudges the house towards him. Max gasps at how smooth the hinges are. He claps and breathes out, "It's beautiful!" Then he narrows his eyes in mischief. "So you gave up on physics homework for this?"</p>
<p>"Mom's out. Dad's more than happy to help." Landon shrugs. "Told him the other day about the 'lighthouse' thing Lily told us, and that we wanted our own. It took us two weeks on this."</p>
<p>"...Uh, lighthouse?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, lighthouse." Landon tilts his head, quizzical. "Remember? The Northern Star?"</p>
<p>"Naren Star?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that."</p>
<p>"But what does that have to do with this?"</p>
<p>"Huh? This is a house..." Landon presses a button on the side of the wooden base. The light bulb turns on, throwing a warm glow over his renewed airy grin. "...and it has a light! Light-house!"</p>
<p>Max bursts out laughing. A man down in the street looks over and his dog barks. Landon blinks and joins in. When Max finally recovers, clutching his aching side, sweating a little, and wiping his eyes, he says,</p>
<p>"Landon, this is brilliant. I'm not just talking about the light."</p>
<p>The pun sets them off again.</p>
<p>"So," Landon finally asks, "what else is brilliant?"</p>
<p>"The pun on lighthouse, obviously."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"...huh?" Max peers at him. "Wait... you really don't know? Hold on..." Max jumps back to his house and returns with his phone. He searches for pictures of lighthouses and shows them to Landon, whose jaw drops.</p>
<p>"Lily was talking about a <em>tower</em>?" He demands. "Her grandpa lives in a <em>tower</em>? Oh, <em>wow</em>! I had no idea---" Landon swipes the screen and stops. "Hey, there <em>are</em> ones with houses!"</p>
<p>"Those are residential, I think. They're where the keepers live. The actual lighthouse is still the tower."</p>
<p>"But why---I-I guess that was why dad chuckled after he saw this..." Landon scratches his head. "Alright. This isn't a light tower---"</p>
<p>"Lighthouse."</p>
<p>"---but it's still a light-house. It's a house."</p>
<p>"Let's just call it a beacon." Max smiles. "It's still awesome! So, do you have the wiring and battery all in the base?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Dad routed those. I only put the house together. He's waiting on a small solar panel and a capacitor, so we can do away with changing batteries."</p>
<p>"That's so cool... Are you gonna put it on your roof?"</p>
<p>"Probably put it somewhere inconspicuous. That way, both of us can see it, and the girls, too, if they know to look for it." Landon rubs his chin. "But not mom."</p>
<p>"Nope. Can't have her think you're slacking off." Max nods. "But you know who else will give you a hard time if she knew you weren't doing your homework?"</p>
<p>"Hmm... Guess Lily won't know about this, either..."</p>
<p>Max tuts.</p>
<p>"OK! You have a point." Landon throws out his hands. "I'm doing my physics!"</p>
<p>"I'll help." Max laughs.</p>

<p>Landon tucked his light-house in the corner where the dormer to his room meets the lower roof. The tree in his yard blocks most of the light, making it hard to see from the street---only if you're an adult. Landon had his dad confirm it. But for Max and his friends, if they walk down the block from the Main Street, they can just glimpse the glint of that warm white light between the tips of branches, and keep it in sight. Lily says she can see the cap of the Lego figure from certain angles. Julia confirms this with a small spyglass. Mae asks how will they see it in summer, when the leaves grow back and block it completely. Landon admits he never considered that.</p>
<p>"But that's still half a year away. Besides, if I revealed it to mom during summer vacation, she couldn't scold me for slacking off with studies."</p>
<p>Max doesn't think the summer leaves would pose a problem. Night falls late in Alvarian summers; they won't see the light on their way home to begin with. Besides, they run around on the roofs at night. There's nothing to obscure the light-house up <em>there</em>. Indeed, on the first couple nights, the light-house sprays its light unhindered all over Max's window, and it's so bright that even with his shades down, Max is blasted by enough in the face to have trouble fall asleep. Landon catches on what's happening quickly from his yawns and baggy eyes. He hooks a light sensor and a clock to the bulb, and points the sensor at Max's window. Every night, after 10 pm and when Max's room dims down, the light-house turns itself off.</p>
<p>"Having an engineer for a dad really helps." Landon winks and grins his grin.</p>
<p>Halloween evening. After sending off their moms, the little sisters, and little brother for trick-or-treating, Landon's dad gathers Landon and his friends around the light-house. He sets the clock ahead and everyone takes turns shining flashlights at the sensor to see if it's enough to turn it back on. Max is ready to believe they broke it somehow, because all five of their flashlights combined can't do it. Then Lily pulls out a laser pointer and the gang erupts into excitement. Very soon, it evolves into a game of how far back they can go and still trigger the sensor. Two meters, five meters, and on the top roof of Max's house; these stretch to the top roof of the other house next to Max's, the street, and beside the growing bonfire in Landon's backyard, where all their four dads are busying over s'mores, hot chocolate, blankets, projectors, and ghost story books.</p>
<p>"What are you playing?" Lily's dad leans over.</p>
<p>"Engineering." Landon's dad chuckles.</p>
<p>Later that night, Max wakes up for bathroom. Upon his return, he is greeted by a light at the window. He goes over, and indeed, Landon's light-house is throwing its warm light over---and it's off. Max looks around his room. He didn't turn on anything, so he definitely isn't blocking any light source that triggered the light-house. <em>Sensor malfunction?</em> Yawning, he moves away. <em>I'll tell Landon in the morning---</em> His shadow flares up on the wall just as he reaches his bed. Max jumps and turns around. The light-house is on. Frowning, Max braces himself to climb out into the cold night and press the button. As though reading his mind, the light flickers and dies... only to flare back into life behind his turned back. He pulls on his turtleneck and makes for the window. The light shuts off immediately. <em>That means nothing.</em> He thinks. <em>I'm unplugging it no matter what.</em> Cold air seeps in from the window. Max shivers. <em>Is this worth the trouble, venturing out there in the dead of the night?</em> He waits, staring. <em>It's not back on for a while.</em> So he shuts the window and pulls off his sweater. <em>Good. Stay off---</em> Max whips around by his bed and makes for his clothes. <em>I'd think it's Landon's prank if it were April Fool's Day!</em> He yawns again, raising the window.</p>
<p>The light blinks.</p>
<p>Max stops his foot halfway to the windowsill. In a few seconds, the light blinks again: three short, three long, and three short. He holds his breath, foot still hanging in midair, heartbeat quickening.</p>
<p>Three short, three long, and three short.</p>
<p>Max may not have an engineer for a dad, but he can still recognize the "SOS" signal. What's the chance of a malfunction producing that pattern, twice---and now a third time, followed by more patient short dots and longer dashes? Max recognizes words like "hurt", "no", and "me". The thing is <em>communicating</em> to him!</p>
<p>With shivers that have nothing to do with the cold, Max slams his window shut and ducks under his sheets, his mind full of <em>Ghostbusters</em>, <em>Five Nights at Freddie's</em>, and Stephen King's <em>Christine</em>.</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>A couple of days after midterm exam scores came down, Max hears a crash from outside that sends his pen flying out of his hand. He picks it up by his window, and sees Landon fighting to stop his mom from reaching out of <em>his</em> window.</p>
<p>"No, it has nothing to do with that---" Landon grunts.</p>
<p>"You waste all your time making shits like this instead of <em>studying</em>---" Mrs. Flinn shrieks.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Landon! I'm so sorry!" Landon's little sister, Maura, sobs from his door, out of view.</p>
<p>"I <em>did</em> study!" Landon wrenches his mom back, who makes for the window again. "I listened to Max and---"</p>
<p>"And all the while having your mind on this piece of garbage or the next!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry...! I should've kept my mouth shut and known the light has to do with you..."</p>
<p>"Quit it, Mau! I've told you it's not your fault!" Landon turns to yell, and whips back around to his mother. His hair is no longer swept back, but hangs forward and covers his forehead in sweaty strands. His brows that have always been far apart and giving him that carefree look are now almost touching. His eyes bulge, and his cheeks flush a bright crimson that matches his hair. Max has never seen his jawline so clearly, and when Landon opens his lips to growl, his teeth gnash so hard that they seem to be on the verge of cracking. "<em>My light-house is not garbage!</em>" A November gust whistles into the open window, and steam flare out from Landon's nose. "I don't see you talk about my art history or music---"</p>
<p>"What good do those do? Do you think you have a chance with music? Your little band gets a spot in Shamrock and Eagle because Old Bart can't find another band in Alvar. Or do you think you can earn a living with that shit out there because you know how long Da Vinci drew <em>Mona Lisa</em>?"</p>
<p>Landon heaves and glares.</p>
<p>"That is going into the bin, along with <em>all</em> of your toolboxes!" His mom snaps, reaching out of the window at the light-house. She pauses and disappears behind the wall. Then she reappears with a hammer.</p>
<p>Landon quivers like a volcano ready to erupt. Maura whimpers something about a glint of light on their roof and she asked mom what it was. Mrs. Flinn hangs halfway out of the window. She tries to hammer the light-house but is only able to crack the tiles an inch too close.</p>
<p>Max gulps. He rips up his window and throws himself onto his roof. His sweater gets snagged by the corner of a tile. A loud and embarrassing <em>riiiiiip</em> goes off like a fart, but Max presses on with the momentum. He scrambles onto Landon's roof and, as Mrs. Flinn presses down on the hammer hoisting herself out, snatches the light-house into his arms. The Lego captain sways precariously on his platform like Max sways on the roof, but it ultimately holds its footing thanks to the fishing lines Landon used to secure him, just like Max, who is reeled back by Landon's mom (sans the hammer) by the trailing strands of yarn from his sweater (R.I.P.) into her arms. The woman and the boy look at each other.</p>
<p>"Can I have it, since you're throwing it out, anyway?" Max finds his small voice. The world freezes. All he can hear is his frantic heart. "I love Landon's stuff." Mrs. Flinn glares. Max suppresses a shiver. He's going to cry. "I-I h-ahem---I helped him with physics homework. It's-it's my fault he failed..."</p>
<p>Behind Mrs. Flinn, Maura sneaks the abandoned hammer back inside.</p>

<p>How long is ten years?</p>
<p>Right after Landon's light-house was relocated to the top of Max's dormer, his mom confiscated his phone. His dad taught him and Julia Morse code when he returned from his business trip, and for nearly a year, Landon and Julia communicated through the light-house. That year must've felt like ten for them.</p>
<p>After Landon reclaimed his phone, Mae's mom was remarried to Mr. Mackenzie, the owner of the bookshop in town. The wedding was serene and happy. But for Max and Mae, both of whom finally mustered up their courage to reveal their relationship to Mae's mom, it was an hour of jumpy nerves and cold hands and deliberate avoidance of each other's eyes---the fact that Mae in a bridesmaid dress looked like an angel didn't help, either. That hour before Mae took his hand and Cate said, "Hi, Max" and the three of them giggled at the realization that they were the same shy and awkward type, dragged on like ten years.</p>
<p>For four more years, Cate and Mr. Mackenzie would grace the remaining performances of Landon's band in the Shamrock and Eagle (a couple of which became Landon/Max duos, because the rest of the gang didn't attend the University of Banon nearby; but Old Bart the Bartender did join in once, because he took his sabbatical from U of B in his tavern to write music), until Landon snagged an opportunity to study music in Vienna on scholarship for a year. Yes, they all had phones, and yes, they videoed often. But when those hour-long shit-talks and whinings and jokes ended, Landon was thrown back into the strange city, living alone, cooking alone, studying, writing and playing music, and speaking German alone. Girls in the pub at which he performed part-time whispered that he couldn't possibly be American. He didn't feel like himself, either. When he finally returned to Alvar (sporting a light late-teen beard and letting Old Bart dig through his luggage full of songs he had written) and held Julia once more in his arms, he felt he would never turn back to that carefree, flamboyant, and stereotypical loud Landon Flinn the American again. He told everyone he earned himself another year of scholarship in Vienna. Mrs. Flinn looked thrilled and proud. Julia choked and whispered that would be another ten years.</p>
<p>That was the last time Max saw Landon or Julia or even Mae. It was <em>his</em> turn to travel. He wasn't content with sticking to plain old theoretical history like his parents did, so he switched majors to the more hands-on and empirical archaeology. Elves had revealed themselves five years ago (now thinking back, it was strange how little fuss there was about it all), and Max's diligence earned him a place in an elven professor's lab. He traveled to the Otherworld for classes on elven history, culture, and excavation practices. He saw Lily from time to time, who TA'ed a couple courses and even lectured on one. It was in her class that Max learned about her ties to the elves, and why her "grandpa" lived in a lighthouse. He reminded her afterward at dinner about Landon's light-house, and they laughed again over how, late in that Halloween night, Lily had pointed her laser in Max's direction out of boredom to see if the sensor could still pick it up from two streets away, and if she could read his mind at that distance.</p>
<p>"Landon and Julia can still communicate in Morse code, I've heard." Max said.</p>
<p>"I'm an inspiration to all." Lily tossed her hair.</p>
<p><em>Shame that neither laser nor beacon light travels between worlds,</em> Max mused, <em>especially not with the time dilation here.</em></p>
<p>How long is ten years? Not long; Having lived 30 years at the age of 22, Max's answer surprises even himself. To his elf mentor, the answer might even be "ephemeral". Max's nose is no longer a squat button but a long and tall ridge. His cheeks lost all that baby fat, but are not too hollow, thankfully. His jaws also became sharp and angular. All the fieldwork buffed his muscles and tanned his face. He is glad he shaves every morning and avoided the beard tan many of his peers have. In ten ephemeral years he went from a shy and cowering boy to what his mentor introduces as a "refined and sharp young man" at conferences. Being around elves does that to you; just look at Lily and her parents. But hey, at least Max keeps his wavy hair.</p>
<p>The broadcast announces the boarding call for his train. Max looks away from the mirror and dries his hands. Time to go home.</p>
<center>
---
</center>
<p>"You never told me you're coming back today." Mae looks at Max this way and that, tucking in his curls and smoothing out ceases of his collar. Like Max, her face slimmed over the years, making her already big eyes seem even bigger. Her braid on one side flows around to the back and merges with the rest of her red hair not into the bun she had worn for so long, but a thick and fluffy ponytail. Some strands wrap around her neck and down her front, as though a glowing scarf against her navy peacoat. Max blushes and looks down. A heavy, white woolen dress---this is so Mae. Mae is still Mae.</p>
<p>"I wanted to give you a surprise..." Max teeters on his heels. His hand grips a small box in his pocket and starts to sweat. "Um... How---?"</p>
<p>"Lily told me." Mae reaches for his duffle bag. The ring on her hand gives Max a start. In twelve years---no, in just <em>four</em> solar years, a lot has changed, it seems.</p>
<p>"Oh no. I can take it." He smiles at her. It comes so naturally. He can never <em>not</em> smile at her. <em>But Lily didn't tell me... Must be to not distract me.</em></p>
<p>"Let me take <em>you</em>, then." She slides her arm around his instead. "Did you get even taller?"</p>
<p>"It must be my back being straighter. The elves, you know."</p>
<p>"Yeah." Mae sighs.</p>
<p>They make their way off of the empty platform, and out of Alvar Train Station. The town is basked in a golden late afternoon sun. The Main Street stretches before them, at first a slow and gradual incline, then a steeper slope past Avenue Road, and at last hits the foot of Alvar Hill at Hill Road. The whole town rises along, layer after layer after layer of houses adorned with red tile roofs and arched roof-bridges in between. It always looks like a bastion to Max. At the hilltop beyond, reaching above all out of the background, is the gleaming dome of Alvar Observatory, or Tenae's Eye to the elves, Max, and his friends. Alvar's local archaeologist, Beatrice McNeal, just gave a talk on it at a recent conference. She promised to take Max inside when he's in town. Max and his friends used to be fascinated by the tower---to enter it now as a researcher, and as Aunt Bea's colleague, no less---Max can't help but draw Mae closer and smile a little. Mae glances at him and furrows her brows playfully. She leads him up Main Street, turns onto Trinity Road, and up East 1st Street, retracing a path they tread too many times years ago after school.</p>
<p>"How's Cate?" Max breathes out.</p>
<p>"Mom's been busy." Mae leans on him. "Elven-style binding is the next biggest thing, and you know, she's the only one in the state who knows how to do it, if not this side of the Mississippi."</p>
<p>Lily's mom invited an elf over to teach Mae's mom the Way of the Books. Max remembers the day when a sail ship emerged from the foams of Alvar Pond behind the hill.</p>
<p>"So the Treasure Trove is doing well, too. That's great to hear. Has your dad been giving you any trouble?"</p>
<p>"No. But I do try to visit him."</p>
<p>"Mae..."</p>
<p>"Mr. Mackenzie give me that look, too." Mae giggles.</p>
<p>Her ring presses against his sleeves and Max ignores it the best he can, determined to feel only Mae's presence, and yet more, in what little intimate time he has left with her. His next question keeps getting stuck in his throat, and he wonders if she cuddles whoever gifted her the ring like she cuddles him. He sighs instead.</p>
<p>Unlike Lily, Max couldn't leave the Otherworld freely during the school year. In those ten years, he relied on her for news from home and short messages to send back home. Every calendar year, he was allowed to come back for a solar week. Crossing between the worlds and the temporal discrepancy disoriented him and gave him heavy jet-lags. He spent most of his fuzzy holidays knocked out in his dorm, squeezing in one long email to his parents and another to Mae, and back he went into the Otherworld. He was never able to receive their replies.</p>
<p>Max doesn't blame her to fall for someone else.</p>
<p>They weave through the roads and streets in silence, passing Mae's home, the spot where her dad nearly killed her, and Shamrock and Eagle. Old Bart still has the poster of Landon's band up on one of the windows---he made it himself for his future student, after all: Landon is strumming his guitar in the front, flanked by Lily and Mae by the mics. Max spots his small figure on violin with Julia in the back. Old Bart's wife took the photo during their audition without anyone noticing, and many more in later shows. Back down they go, both with a faint smile. At the Treasure Trove, they paused to look at the gold-and-silver lined, leather-bound books. Mae's mom has branched out from the Bible. There's a Lord of the Rings trilogy, a poetry collection of Keats, and a dictionary. Max gazes past them at the reflection of Mae's ring. The corners of his lips flatten.</p>
<p>"Does he treat you well?" He murmurs.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>Max's eyes refocus on <em>Keats</em>.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mackenzie."</p>
<p>"Oh." Mae's eyes dim and fixate on <em>Keats</em>, too. "Very."</p>
<p>"Do you want that?" The corners of the box in his pocket hurt his palm.</p>
<p>"I already have one." Mae gives a soft snort. "It was my coming-of-age gift."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>The sun is touching the houses in the west. November chill sprays down like a mist. Mae hugs his arm tighter. He leans in. What's the point? No matter how they relive the bygone days, they're gone. Lily is out on the Isle with the elves. Landon and Julia moved to Europe. He himself will flit between excavating the site in Sherwood, England and studying its finds in the Otherworld once more. Mae? Probably back to college, back to---Twelve years. They're not who they were. Alvar is not that Alvar he grew up in anymore.</p>
<p>At the park on Rose Road and West 4th Street, Mae sits him down on a bench. It's damp from the chill. The sun dips behind the slope of houses in the still air. The sapphire ring around the base of the dome of Tenae's Eye emits a faint blue glow. An achingly familiar sight, but Max feels painfully forlorn. <em>Forlorn</em>---like how Ruth had felt, as she stood in tears amid the alien corn. Keats' words. Mae's favorite. Max drops his gaze to his bag between his feet.</p>
<p>"Are you alright?" Mae frowns and peers closely at his face.</p>
<p>"Just getting used to being back, that's all." He leans away.</p>
<p>"Landon can help with that." Mae points. There in the distance is the dormer he grew up under. Fastened on top of it is the same light-house he dreamed over and again in the Otherworld and later in the field. Over the years, he visited actual lighthouses: regular striped towers by the shore, an unmaned beacon on a rock out in the sea, the mythical Naren Star at the edge of a marsh in Norway, the short and stubby sparkplug Spring Point Ledge in Maine, ancient Roman rock towers that burned wood, and modern concrete and steel structures that ran on electricity. But Landon's yellowing plexiglass house outshines them all. Like Tenae's Eye, it starts its glow. Mae continues, "He replaced the capacitor the first thing he came back."</p>

<p><em>When?</em> Max wonders.</p>
<p>The bell in the east strikes four. The venerable chimes disperse Max's thought and reverberate under a sky red and orange and yellow and blue. Thuds follow in its wake. A couple boys and girls dart over the roof across the street. Another group follows, and another. It's the parkour of Alvarian children---Mae and Max used to do it. Max can't believe they used to do it. They run along the edge of roofs, leap across gaps in between, vault over chimneys, and skid on top of the roof-bridges, laughing and calling out to each other. Those who know the routes and have the fitness for them can cross the entire town without ever touching the ground. The dried leaves red and yellow that escaped the street cleaners and their vacuums trail behind them, flying and floating and spiraling down from the roofs, hitting the road below like splats of paint. <em>Looks dangerous.</em> Max snorts.</p>
<p>"School's out." Mae leans her head on his shoulder and wraps her arm around him. Her warm gardenia scent rises out of her hair and her coat. Max's heart melted. He musters up his courage.</p>
<p>"Nice ring." He prods it.</p>
<p>"Lily gave it to me for my last birthday!" She beams her brightest and sits up. "Look---it changes size if you twist it like this... Isn't it amazing? I always worry that rings might get stuck on my finger and I won't be able to get it off. Not this one! Lily said it's standard-issue on the Isle for humans. She said it lets them use elven arts. Obviously, she doesn't need one, but they still gave one to her, so she gave it to me---it's not powered, though, so I can't really make things float and stuff..." She giggles, long lashes touching.</p>
<p>And Max feels very stupid indeed.</p>
<p>How could he miss that? The change of color between gold and silver at different angles, the strip of gem embedded down the middle, the floral design, and the twisting mechanism, all stereotypical elven. He has even <em>seen</em> lecturers wear them before.</p>
<p>"Oh..." His cheeks feel like on fire. "Wow. We don't even get these at the U... Good for you, Mae. It really suits you!" He grins, sheepish. "Um... how have you been these years?"</p>
<p>Mae raises a brow and pouts.</p>
<p>"Finally, you asked!"</p>
<p>"I, um..." Max's grin grows broader. "I was... It's been twelve years, after all---I thought..."</p>
<p>"Four, Max." Mae cups his cheek. "Four, okay? Four years since you left for the University." Her wide green eyes are wet. Max can't look away. "Stay with me," she whispers. "It's only been <em>four solar years</em>."</p>
<p>Max blinks and nods. Mae's eyes sparkle like a clear pond. They were what had him so captivated all those years back in elementary school. The worry, grief, longing, and gentleness welling out of them stifle his breath. Blindly he fishes out the small box and opens it.</p>
<p>"Do you think you have room for another?"</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"It's a ring from one of the sites in Minas Taurënúr---the, um, the Sherwood site. My mentor said I could keep it." Max's lips go dry. He glances at the light-house yonder. Landon has emerged onto the roof and is showing passing children how it works. Julia and Lily join them. Lily seems to be glancing their way. <em>Where should you be looking at?</em> Her voice cuts across his mind. So Max focuses back on Mae. "I dreamed of you, Mae. All those years---um, those ten <em>calendar</em> years and two solar years and more calendar years scattered throughout those two solar years. Not <em>every</em> day but---" Mae raises her brows, patient. Max takes a deep breath. "---I missed you. I'm sorry I couldn't message much."</p>
<p>"I know. Because so did I."</p>
<p>Max gathers her in. Heart pounding, he glances again at the light-house. Lily is showing the children how to control it with a laser pointer. There's something he never had the courage to utter. How did they not break up all those years, really, without ever saying this?</p>
<p>"I love you, Mae."</p>
<p>"I know." Mae giggles. "Welcome home, Max." She takes a long whiff of his collar. "Welcome home."</p>
