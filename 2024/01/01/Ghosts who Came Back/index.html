    <p>Grandma started attracting ghosts.</p>
<p>She was doing something on the balcony one evening, perhaps taking care of her spider plants, Christmas cacti, clivia, and aloes. But I found her in my room, too, rifling through a drawer I had left open. Wasn't she on the balcony, I asked her, but she kept going, and looked at me like a stranger. The room was dark. The only light came from the sliver that passed into the hallway from the living room, where my grandma just went back in. I looked back and forth, and ran out. Grandma sat down in her usual sofa. Mom was in the other one. I cried that there was an intruder, that someone looking like grandma was stealing our stuff. Mom jumped up and strode past me. She came out annoyed. She gave me a slap on the back and told me that was <em>her</em> grandmother, my great-grandmother. Grandma had dozed off. Mom glanced at her and muttered, <em>So, it started.</em></p>
<p>Great-grandmother appeared again the next evening. She lingered in the dim hallway, watching grandma dozing in the sofa. I curled up in my chair, arms around my knees, and face in my arms, peeking at her. She had the same stooping, plump figure, and triangular eyes. Her hair was cut to shoulder-length, gleaming white. Our eyes met. The blankness in hers that was never present in my grandma's sent a shiver down to my stomach. I tried to yell, to tell her go away, but I couldn't manage any more than a hoarse whisper. Mom heard my rasps and came in from the kitchen. I pointed and whimpered, <em>Make her go away.</em> Mom slapped my hand down, and scolded me for the ruckus. It was rude to point, she snapped in a low voice, couldn't I see grandma was sleeping. I kept screeching, hoarse, about the ghost of my great-grandmother. Mom scowled and finally turned to the hallway. She banished her hand.</p>
<p>- Go, go. She's napping. Come back later.</p>
<p>The little spark of recognition in great-grandmother's eyes fizzled into disappointment.</p>
<p>She didn't show up again. At least, not in front of me. Time passed, and others started to come. Men, women, old, young, some looked familiar, some I'd never seen before. They lurked in the shadows after dusk, unsmiling, wordless, watching with their for most part stoic eyes. On occasion there could come a quiver of recognition, a hint of longing, a drop of warmth, a flicker of sorrow. All eyes were on grandma. They didn't look at mom or me unless we tried to get their attention.</p>
<p>Winter nights fell early. One evening, I came home from school before mom did. The living room was dim, lit only by the TV blaring near full-volume at a snoozing grandma. I covered my ears and struggled to wade through the din for the remote control. A hand grabbed it from the dark. It took a few tries before succeeding in muting the TV.</p>
<p>It was great-grandmother. She shuffled her way to grandma's sofa. I watched, spell-bound, as she stroked grandma's hands folded over her stomach, and also her face, as though trying to pat down the flyaway hair. I trembled hard with fright, but I managed to move over and gave great-grandmother a shove. My hands passed through her, cold, icy, freezing. I climbed back to my feet and wrung my bag. It glided through her, almost hitting grandma. I couldn't touch her; she couldn't touch me. But the remote: I grabbed that. It had been close to the TV, and had picked up its heat. I jabbed it at her. She finally budged, and retreated beyond the flickering TV light, resigned.</p>
<p>Grandma gurgled and woke up. She looked at me waving the remote into the shadows. She looked at the silent TV. She turned on the lamp next to the phone on the side stand. She asked me what I was doing. I stammered there were ghosts. She folded her ear and said, <em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>- There are ghosts! --- I yelled loud enough for her to hear.</p>
<p>- They're for me! --- She laughed in her usual yelling tone. --- What are you scared about?</p>
<p>She beckoned me into a hug, and banished her hand like my mom.</p>
<p>- This is my grandson! See? Later, later you lot. --- She turned to me, pointing out each one. --- That's my mother. That's your granduncle. That's your aunt. See? You're named after her. You two looked alike when little. Oi! Later, you lot! They're kids I took care of during the war. --- She chuckled and searched among the shadows filing into the dark hallway beyond. She sighed after great-grandmother left last. --- What are you scared of? They're our families, coming to visit me. What time is it? Oh, you must be hungry.</p>
<p>Were they here to take her away? I found the old electric mosquito racket. I remembered being burnt by it when I was much younger. For evenings and nights I stood guard by the hallway, brandishing it at the dead relatives, telling them to leave my grandma alone. Some retreated. Some dispersed under the hot racket. Mom told me off but grandma just chuckled, yelling that leave me be; they had other ways in.</p>
<p>She must meant the balcony. For days, I racked my brains for a way to block that.</p>
<p>Mom caught me dragging my heater out of my room one night. It had glowing tubes in front of a curved tin foil. It was hot. It gave light. It radiated heat in a wide area. It ran on its own. It was the perfect barrier. Mom had been quite patient with this until now. She demanded to know what I was doing. Was I crazy? Did I want to catch a fever? Ghosts come for everyone in the end, and they were families, too. They'd come for mom in the future, including grandma. Would I beat grandma off, too?</p>
<p>I tumbled down to the cold floor bawling my eyes out. Mom took away the mosquito racket and returned the heater to my room. She came back saying it was late; quiet down or I'd wake grandma. I didn't stop. I didn't care, not grandma's sleep, not mom's shaking, not my bums cold from the floor, nothing --- only that the ghosts were given pass and now they passed us like cold drafts from outside. They were going to take grandma away. Mom at last carried me in her arms and sat down in grandma's sofa. I sobbed into her.</p>
<p><em>Look,</em> she took a deep breath and said to me, <em>there's still time.</em> She swayed her arms and rocked me down to sniffs. She said I should be happy for grandma to have so many to come walk the way with her. Not many had so many people who held them dear or in gratitude. Her other grandmother had only two come. Mom patted me and said it was good to see all the people again. She wished they could talk, so they could tell me how proud they were of me and my good grades, for they had always kept an eye on me. She said they couldn't smile, but she knew they really wanted to --- unless I kept trying to beat them back. Grandma must be less scared because of them accompanying her. And way, way in the future, she and mom would come for me, too, so I'd be less scared --- Her hand stopped, and I heard a soft gasp. I followed her eyes and saw an old man in suit and tie emerge from the hallway. His grey hair was swept back, and he had thick brows. He was thin. At grandma's door, he paused and looked back at us. Mom sniffed and waved my hand. After a moment, she said,</p>
<p>- Look how much he's grown, Pa.</p>
<p>The old man nodded slowly at the edge of the glow from our lamp, the tips of his lips curved as far up as they could. To compensate for that tiny distance, he squinted his eyes. He raised a firm hand in greeting, and knocked without a sound. He turned the knob, and passed through the door.</p>
