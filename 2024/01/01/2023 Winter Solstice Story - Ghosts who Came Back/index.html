    <blockquote>
<p>There was initially no "2023 Winter Solstice Story". I had a writer's block that year. Then, three days after the solstice, a quite chilling dream came around, and I was too shaken to not turn it into this story. As with all of my dream-inspired stories, this was categorized as a "Forbidden Dreams". I was adamant not making this a WWS at the time because frankly it was conceived after the solstice day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Two years later, however, my mind begins to change. For one, the glaring absence of a 2023 WSS is too hard to ignore. One of the original goals of WSSs was to push myself to produce at least one story every year. I remember writing <em>something</em> that year, and looking back, yes, I did write <em>Ghosts who Came Back</em> (written in a day, after three revisions), albeit I started late. For another, upon revisiting this story, I begin to feel that it really does fit the WSSs: it has a bleak and <em>wintry</em> tone, but ends with a small warmth, like low flames in a hearth, or dregs of hot tea, or the smell of cinnamon. It is as Winter Solstice Story as a story can get.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So here we have a first in the WSS tradition: a story that is retro-categorized as a WSS, but also filed under two categories---a Forbidden Dream that is a Winter Solstice Story. Seeing how my stories are increasing in length year by year, this three-pager stands out even more, not just as a breach of tradition but also a return to my roots.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a strikingly Chinese ghost story, but also not exactly a ghost story in a traditional sense. It's not meant to be scary; it's meant to be about family, tradition, and love. I hope you enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grandma started attracting ghosts.</p>
<p>I knew she was on the balcony that evening, taking care of her spider plants, Christmas cacti, clivia, and aloes, but I found her in my room, too, rifling through a drawer I had left open. I asked her when she'd come inside, but she kept on rifling, and looked at me like a stranger. The room was dark. The only light came from the sliver that passed into the hallway from the living room, where my grandma had just returned. I looked back and forth, and ran out. Grandma sat down in her usual sofa. Mom was in the other one. I cried that there was an intruder, that someone looking like grandma was stealing our stuff. Mom jumped up and strode past me. She came out annoyed. She gave me a slap on the back and told me that was <em>her</em> grandmother, my great-grandmother. Grandma had dozed off. Mom glanced at her and muttered, <em>So, it started.</em></p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>Great-grandmother appeared again the next evening. She lingered in the dim hallway, watching grandma doze in the sofa. I curled up in my chair, arms around my knees, and face in my arms, peeking out at her. She had the same stooping, plump figure, and triangular eyes. Her hair was cut to shoulder-length, gleaming white. Our eyes met. The blankness in her eyes sent a shiver down to my stomach. I tried to yell, to tell her go away, but I couldn't manage any more than a hoarse whisper. Mom heard my rasps and came in from the kitchen. I pointed and whimpered, <em>Make her go away.</em> Mom slapped my hand down, and scolded me. It was rude to point, she snapped in a low voice, couldn't I see grandma was sleeping. I kept screeching, hoarse, about the ghost of my great-grandmother. Mom scowled and finally turned to the hallway. She banished my great-grandmother with her hand.</p>
<p>- Go, go. She's napping. Come back later.</p>
<p>The little spark of recognition in great-grandmother's eyes fizzled into disappointment.</p>
<p>She didn't show up again. At least, not in front of me. Time passed, and others started to come. Men, women, old, young, some looked familiar, some I'd never seen before. They lurked in the shadows after dusk, unsmiling, wordless, watching with their stoic eyes. On occasion there could come a quiver of recognition, a hint of longing, a drop of warmth, a flicker of sorrow. All eyes were on grandma. They didn't look at mom or me unless we tried to get their attention.</p>
<p>Winter nights fell early. One evening, I came home from school before mom did. The living room was dim, lit only by the TV blaring near full-volume at a snoozing grandma. I covered my ears and struggled to wade through the din for the remote control. A hand grabbed it from the dark. It took a few tries before succeeding in muting the TV.</p>
<p>It was great-grandmother. She shuffled her way to grandma's sofa. I watched, spell-bound, as she stroked grandma's hands folded over her stomach, and also her face, as though trying to pat down the flyaway hair. I trembled hard with fright, but I managed to move over and gave great-grandmother a shove. My hands passed through her, cold, icy, freezing. I climbed back to my feet and wrung my bag. It glided through her, almost hitting grandma. I couldn't touch her; she couldn't touch me. But the remote: I grabbed that. It had been close to the TV, and had picked up its heat. I jabbed it at her. She finally budged, and retreated beyond the flickering TV light, resigned.</p>
<p>Grandma gurgled and woke up. She looked at me waving the remote into the shadows. She looked at the silent TV. She turned on the lamp next to the phone on the side stand. She asked me what I was doing. I stammered, <em>there were ghosts.</em> She folded her ear and said, <em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>- There are ghosts! --- I yelled loud enough for her to hear.</p>
<p>- They're here for me! --- She laughed in her usual yelling tone. --- What are you scared about?</p>
<p>She beckoned me into a hug, and banished the ghosts the way my mom did.</p>
<p>- This is my grandson! See? Later, later you lot. --- She turned to me, pointing out each one. --- That's my mother. That's your granduncle. That's your aunt. See? You're named after her. You two looked alike when little. Oi! Later, you lot! They're kids I took care of during the war. --- She chuckled and searched among the shadows filing into the dark hallway beyond. She sighed after great-grandmother left last. --- What are you scared of? They're our family, coming to visit me. What time is it? Oh, you must be hungry.</p>
<p>They must be here to take grandma away. I found an old electric mosquito racket. I remembered being burnt by it when I was much younger. For evenings and nights, I stood guard by the hallway, brandishing it at the dead relatives, warning them to leave my grandma alone. Some retreated. Some dispersed under the hot racket. Mom told me off but grandma just chuckled. In her usual loud voice, she told mom to leave me be; there are other ways in anyways. She meant the balcony. For days, I racked my brains for a way to block it.</p>
<p>Mom caught me dragging my heater out of my room one night. It had glowing tubes in front of a curved tin foil. It was hot, and bright, and blasted heat everywhere. It ran on its own. It was the perfect barrier. Mom had been quite patient with this until now. She demanded to know what I was doing. Was I crazy? Did I want to catch a fever? Ghosts come for everyone in the end. Didn't I know? They'd come for mom. <em>Grandma</em> would come back for mom. Would I beat grandma off, too?</p>
<p>I tumbled down to the cold floor bawling my eyes out. Mom took away the mosquito racket and returned the heater to my room. She came back saying it was late; quiet down or I'd wake grandma. I didn't stop. I didn't care, not about grandma's sleep, not about mom's shaking, not about my bum freezing on the floor, nothing --- except that the ghosts were given pass, and passed us like cold drafts from outside. They were going to take grandma away. Mom at last carried me in her arms and sat down in grandma's sofa. I sobbed into her.</p>
<p><em>Look,</em> she took a deep breath and said to me, <em>there's still time.</em> She swayed her arms and rocked me down to sniffs. She said I should be happy for grandma to have so many to walk the way with her. Not many people had so many who held them dear. Her other grandmother had only two. Mom patted me and said it was good to see everyone again. She wished they could talk, so they could tell me how proud they were of me and my good grades, for they had always kept an eye on me. She said they couldn't smile, but she knew they'd really want to --- unless I kept trying to beat them back. Grandma must be less scared because of them accompanying her. And way, way in the future, she and mom would come for me, too, so I'd be less scared --- Her hand stopped, and I heard a soft gasp. I followed her eyes and saw an old man in suit and tie emerge from the hallway. His grey hair was swept back, and he had thick brows. He was thin. At grandma's door, he paused and looked back at us. Mom sniffed and waved my hand for me. After a moment, she said,</p>
<p>- Pa, look how much he's grown.</p>
<p>The old man nodded slowly at the edge of the glow from our lamp, the tips of his lips curved as far up as they could. To compensate for that tiny distance, he squinted his eyes. He raised a firm hand in greeting, and knocked without a sound. He turned the knob, and passed through the door.</p>
