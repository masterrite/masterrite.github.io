    <p>Billy stares out of the glass wall in the cafeteria, chewing on a single grain of rice. Inside, in the soft glow from the high ceiling, the chatter natter grows as people wander in after their day. Outside, beyond the trees and gardens and crop fields, the sun retreats behind Oron Winecaima, “Mt. Cradle”, dyeing the sea and the sky blood red. In between the two is his face, looking 120 instead of 12 from exhaustion. His eyes look even smaller than usual.</p>
<p>Tina collapses into the opposite seat and drops her plate. Billy can barely raise a brow at bits of dirt and grass still in her fraying hair. Flakes of blood and smudges of mud are gone from her cheeks, though. Tina glowers.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>“What? If I showered I’d fall asleep in the bathtub!”</p>
<p>Classic Tina. Billy returns to watching the volcano sending wisps of faint, shadowy vapor into the dusk. <em>Lindsay probably</em> did <em>fall asleep in the tub.</em> The four of them were gone for only two solar weeks, but the view that he has known for two solar years looks so foreign now. Black smoke, smell of sulfur, explosions and whistles of bullets, tasteless bricks of rations—He misses the misty vapors of Oron Winecaima. He misses the salty breeze of the Isle. He misses (unbelievably) the drone of the crowds. He misses rice. He picks up another grain. A pocket of sweetness.</p>
<p>“Four calendar months.” Tina groans. “Finally over.”</p>
<p>“Won’t be our last.”</p>
<p>“I miss recon missions.”</p>
<p>“Join Batu, then.”</p>
<p>“And miss the face you make when you shattered your ring?”</p>
<p>“Get your own rice, Tina.” Billy waves her hand away from his bowl with his chopsticks, just to annoy her.</p>
<p>“Trade ya with a meatball.” She reaches over again.</p>
<p>Billy sighs and struggles up.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“Getting you your <em>own rice</em>.”</p>
<p>Birds glide past the glass, skimming the sun-gilt treetops, the rippling sea, and disappear behind Oron Winecaima. Its vapor grows denser as it raises, and becomes clouds. It’ll get noisy soon. Tina frowns. It’s the scheduled Pressure Release day.</p>
<p>Someone jumps into Billy’s chair. She smells the perfume-soaked bandana around his wrist before she sees Batu’s gelled-up spiky hair and round flat face. Tina wrenches Billy’s plates and bowls to her side of the table.</p>
<p>“Damn, Christina! You’re not letting me eat? After my two-week-long mission?”</p>
<p>“Go away.”</p>
<p>Batu reaches for the rice bowl. Tina slaps his hand away.</p>
<p>“Ow, Tina, that hurts!” Batu clasps his heart. “Right here! I’ve been living off MREs, you know? It wasn’t easy!”</p>
<p>“Don’t call me Tina.”</p>
<p>“But of course you won’t know. They don’t need cute dolls like you on a battlefield!”</p>
<p>Tina has stopped wondering long ago why he thinks what he says is flirting. She leans her head against her wrist and keeps her eyes on the volcano. The white vapor darkens and casts a long, ominous shadow across the Isle and over her. For a second, the laughters, hollers, chatters of silverware, and Batu’s “We were at the defense line sending troops out, Tina. Man! I wish I could go with them!” dim. She was back in the trench, wondering where Robbie is, or Lindsay, or even Billy. Men in cloth tunics, full plates, and then army fatigues fell down beside her. They were training robots and holographs of soldiers, of course; yet it was hard not to feel something, especially after her ring shattered. It’s still hard even now.</p>
<p>“The mortars—<em>damn!</em> So cool—<em>BOOM!</em> Bunch of people fell. We had to retreat because they were blasting into our defense! You’re lucky to see me again, ya know?”</p>
<p>Tina can’t take her eyes off the smoke. She knows what it’s like to fire a shell and to turn people into pieces. It wasn’t cool. It was nauseating. But she had to fire. She had to, or they’d come closer and closer until she and her friends were gone. She had to pull the rope and—</p>
<p>The explosives inside Oron Winecaima sends a torrent of smoke into the air and a chunk of the lip into the sea. Lava overflows and sets trees ablaze as it rolls down towards the beach, guided by an invisible barrier. Somewhere in Tina’s head, a cackle grows louder. Flames jump into existence, snaking out of broken windows and licking the sky. Black smoke chokes the air.</p>
<p>“WHOA!” Batu’s shrill voice sounds muffled. “That’s <em>just like war!</em>“</p>
<p>He bangs the table and the clanking of utensils and plates become falling timbers and clashes of weapons. Tina gasps through her teeth and stuffs her ears. A sliver of her mind tells her to snap out of it. That is soon engulfed by fire and smoke. Another flares into life and reflects she’d rather fall asleep in the tub and miss dinner than relive these horrors. It is drowned in hopelessness and the night. She flits between Tinas from six solar years ago and six calendar days ago, watching her home burn down in her attempt to cook alone for the first time out of hunger and soldiers tumble into her trench, their blood falling right through her.</p>
<center> # </center>

<p>The cafeteria resumes its cacophony after a brief pause. Billy wades through the din back to his table. He didn’t expect to run into first Robbie (who went on awhile about a misstep he realized they had made at their retreat) and then Lindsay (who whined, rather coquettish, at him that she fell asleep in the bathtub). But they know where to find him now.</p>
<p>He gives a start first at Batu in his chair, his wide, bragging mouth ripping a canyon at the lower third of his flat face, and then at a paralyzed Tina staring in horror at the smoke, the lava, and the fire outside. <em>Didn’t she get better after those therapies?</em> He drops the bowl and rocks her shoulders. Tina grabs the bowl.</p>
<p>“Tina? Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>“—I wanted to fight but they said I’m still a kid. Can you belie—What? Where did you come from? Traitor! Piss off! Scram!”</p>
<p>Tina winces at Batu’s scream and clasps her hands back around her ears.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Robbie comes over.</p>
<p>“We should move.” Billy looks up.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Leave Christina and me alone and cry elsewhere! WAHHHHHH!”</p>
<p>Robbie sets down his plates much harder than he meant to. The cafeteria pauses again. Lindsay hurries over, too.</p>
<p>“What’s going on—oh not <em>you</em>…”</p>
<p>“Hey Lindsay! Wanna hear about my last mission?” Batu hollers. The last bit of whispers in the room dies down. Humans and elves, old and young, all turn to them.</p>
<p>“Nobody does. Leave us.” Robbie says.</p>
<p>“I’m not talking to you, Know-it-all! <em>You</em> should leave, like Billy said!”</p>
<p>“Look after her for us.” Lindsay whispers to Billy crouching by the shivering Tina. Batu notices her condition at last.</p>
<p>“Tina! Hey, Christina! What’s wrong—“</p>
<p>“Shut up, will you?” Billy snaps.</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> shut up! She was fine earlier! <em>You</em> made her like that! She was enjoying my story of my mission! <em>You</em> had to mess her up ‘cuz <em>you’re</em> jealous ‘cuz <em>you’ve</em> never been to a <em>war zone</em>—“</p>
<p>“Will you just shut up and leave?” Lindsay snarls. “No one gives a damn—“</p>
<p>Robbie sighs. The retreat he had with Tina, Billy, and Lindsay in the past four calendar months drained his mind. He has no more brains left for tact. They relived four battles across history back-to-back, living on tasteless rations and taking turns shutting their eyes only when they could. They feared for their lives despite knowing they were all just simulations, and the twelve Nanwen elf replica scattered across the field didn’t help. He doesn’t know how they managed to defeat the last one, with both Billy and Tina unable to use elven arts—It took all his willpower to not lose his temper the day prior, when Tina’s ring shattered after Billy’s, and having a temper in the first place was uncharacteristic for him enough. Time in the world for their retreat runs eight times as fast as their homeworld. It’s a temporal ratio none of them had experience with before, and it only adds more physical and mental strain on top of their exhaustion from the simulations. The smell of spaghetti waft over from his plate. His stomach growls and he almost drools. They need food, they need rest, and they need them fast. Screw diplomacy. This is one time Robbie allows himself for wanton violence. <em>Besides… I’ve never paid Batu back for exacerbating Guoben’s abuses for Billy.</em></p>
<p>“Sorry, everyone.” He declares and strides up to Batu. With one fluid swing, he sends Batu flying behind him. Batu rolls and jumps up to retaliate. Robbie is already securing his ring to his finger. Lindsay steps in.</p>
<p>“Outta my way! I deserve better after my two weeks of mission in a <em>war zone</em>—“</p>
<p>“Two what weeks of what mission, exactly?” Lindsay snaps.</p>
<p>“Calendar!” Calls a voice from the crowd.</p>
<p>“recon!” Calls another. A few people stifle their snorts.</p>
<p>“You’re just jealous!” Batu yells back.</p>
<p>“Jealous?” Billy scowls. “Of what? Doing nothing but recon at your stage?”</p>
<p>“Get a replacement mentor already.” Robbie says. “I’d be ashamed if I were you, leeching off novice teams just to fulfill the minimum workload.”</p>
<p>Batu roars and lunges for him. Lindsay repels him with elven art. He springs back and flattens his flat face against her barrier, knocking himself out cold.</p>
<p>The cafeteria bursts into laughter.</p>
<center> # </center>

<p>Tina’s breaths finally ease and her trembles cease. Her hands fall. Lindsay’s and Billy’s anxious faces come into focus.</p>
<p>“What took you so long.” She manages to scoff at last.</p>
<p>“What took <em>you</em> so long.” Billy points. “Robbie and Lindsay are here. Look… We’re all here. It’s alright now.”</p>
<p>Tina peers around. Robbie is walking back wearing a scowl. People are patting him on the back. Batu’s nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“Aura took him.” Robbie sits back down beside Tina and catches her. The chatter in the cafeteria fades away. Lindsay has concealed their table. “It’s okay, Tina. It’s alright now…”</p>
<p>Outside, the smoke has dispersed. The fires have died. Only the glowing lava still trudges towards the sea. Blinds slide down, keeping the night at bay.</p>
<p>Tina watches Billy and Lindsay sit down to eat, and reaches for her fork. It hangs in midair, quivers, and hits the table. Tina is on her feet, holding onto the table for support.</p>
<p>“I’m so—so glad I made friends with y-you.”</p>
<p>The other three looks at each other.</p>
<p>“I r-really am! I never thought—I thought I had it under control—“</p>
<p>“You’re exhausted, that’s all.” Lindsay lays a hand over Tina’s.</p>
<p>“There were too many cues. It was just unfortunate.” Robbie dabs her eyes with a napkin. He holds her shoulders and lets her down. “Don’t worry. We’ll always be here for you.”</p>
<p>“Thanks…thanks for helping me. Thanks for standing up for me. Thanks for bringing me back. Thanks for being my friend… Especially you two.” She glances at Robbie and Billy. “We didn’t start off too well, but—well…”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be here without your music player.” Billy mumbles, blushing.</p>
<p>“It’s all past.” Robbie squeezes her shoulders. “Come on. You must be hungry.”</p>
<p>“Never thought I’d see Tina cry.” Billy mutters.</p>
<p>“You. You forget about what just happened.” Tina juts her chin.</p>
<p>“Me? What, just me? Why—Fine. Whatever.” Billy rolls his eyes at Robbie and offers Lindsay a meatball. Lindsay giggles and has him bite first. Tina tilts her head.</p>
<p>“You know, those two <em>do</em> look pretty cute toget—Hey wait a minute! That’s mine!”</p>
<p>“You traded for my rice!”</p>
<p>“I thanked you just now, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Don’t remember.” Billy smirks into his bowl.</p>
<p>“Why you—“</p>
<p>Lindsay shakes her head at the chuckling Robbie, “Back to bickering again, these two. Yep, she’s definitely alright now.”</p>
