<span id="more"></span>
<p>"Ma Likai you <em>mensao</em> dawg, you've been collecting parts for a build behind my back?" I spin the heavy box by their corners between my fingers. Under the vinyl wrap is a picture of a triple-slot, triple-fan Mvimia 4470 Ti Max in front of an artist's rendition of a black hole. The company is just short of making the words "36GB GDDR12X" the entire box art---It's even bigger than their brand name. I guess they really are trying to sell the concept of "bigger VRAM, better performance". <em>Bah. GPUs used to be for displaying things and games only.</em> My dude grins with his eyes wide and round. It's his way of saying, "Gotcha!" He dragged me over to his room after breakfast just for this. My eyes gleam. "What else have you got?"</p>
<p>"Yo Liuy, is that a <em>graphics card</em>?" Zhan Nima pokes his head in through the open door, his thin, small eyes home in on the box in my hands. Zhan Zhiquan is his real name that no one uses. People call him "Zhan Ye" Master Zhan for his IT skills. I call him "Zhan Nima" because whenever he goes "Heh heh" I think of llamas. "4470 Ti Max. Heh heh. Dope, man, dope. I use that, too. Liuy snagged a 4480 Max."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I snagged a <em>4480 Max</em>, cuz what happened to <em>‘let’s not buy 70 Ti Max and laugh at Mvimia’,</em> eh? Eh, traitor?"</p>
<p>"Heh heh." Nima gives a shifty laugh. "So, uh... Bro Kai’s building?" He comes in, eyes gleaming. "What else have you got?"</p>
<p>"Uh... I got a CPU---"</p>
<p>"<em>Duh.</em> But <em>what else</em> have you <em>got?</em>" We exclaim in unison.</p>
<p>Likai lumbers to his closet and opens the door. His round face impassive, like it always is before exams and checkups. I snort. That's a lot of fans: a 120mm case fan, a 240mm twin fan module, and a 360mm triple fan module. <em>Is he trying to use this as an AC? How many does he need for that chassis?</em> I glance at the unassuming black tower case. Three in the front, two at the bottom, one in the back, but the top could still fit three more. And then I see the box. "Liquid cooling? Whoa, for your first build?"</p>
<p>"Wanna join that novelty bandwagon." Likai answers as though to an interrogation.</p>
<p>"9770x for CPU... why not 9880x3D? Both are eight cores but 80 is faster per core, and the vertical layered cache for wider bandwidth." Nima crouches down and takes out the boxes one by one. "32GB x 2 for RAM at 7,000mHz... MSB B650M motherboard... not bad... Heh heh, KaiWarrior 4TB!" He chortles at the solid-state drive.</p>
<p>"X3D is outta stock." The play on Likai's name glances off his thick skin.</p>
<p>"Good stuff, all of these. Budget brand for some but not too shabby---Ayo..." Nima holds up the final box.</p>
<p>"What's that?" I frown. We know it's a power source unit. It distributes power to the components. But we've never seen the brand before. The box says "KimPlatRiver 850W, 80 PULS Platinum-rated, for 4990 Ti Super Pro Max". The obscure brand, the misspelled "PLUS", the ridiculous "Ti Super Pro Max" suffix, and the claims of 850W supporting a 750W quasi-professional GPU that is usually paired with 120W CPUs leave Nima and I dumbfounded. I look up "KimPlatRiver" on my phone. The first page shows nothing but what a literal bomb the brand's PSU is.</p>
<p>"You gotta return that. How much did you pay for this?" Nima says.</p>
<p>"That's the only thing you don't cheap out." I say.</p>
<p>"Nah. It's too much of a hassle to return. Between this go boom-boom and the liquid cooler go drip-drip, I'll take my chances."</p>
<p>"Hold a moment here---"</p>
<p>"How much did you pay for the <em>cooler</em> now---"</p>
<p>"Bruh, listen to yourself---"</p>
<p>"It's <em>electricity</em> we're talking about here---"</p>
<p>"That thing fails and it can fry your entire computer---"</p>
<p>"What are you and Zhan Ye squawking in there?" Lily pokes her head through the window, bringing in a gush of wintry air. "Oh? PC parts? Likai are you building? Hold up---" She scurries away, shutting the window with a <em>bang</em>. Seconds later, she frisks in through the door, cheeks red from the cold and running. "WHOA! I've never seen this stuff in person! Liuy built his while I was away Are we building now? Can we build it now?"</p>
<p>"There's an issue---" Nima starts.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" I raise my eyebrow at Lily.</p>
<p>"Mom asked me to look after you." Lily draws herself up, smug.</p>
<p>"Which one? Iris, Lindsay, or my mom, who shouldn't even be here?"</p>
<p>"Mine! Both of them! So, are we building it? Are we?"</p>
<p>"Well, there's---" Nima tries again.</p>
<p>"Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it!" Likai waves us off and pushes the boxes out into the open.</p>
<center>
---
</center>
<p>The floor is cleared. The boxes are opened. The metal chassis for the PC stands in the middle of us, surrounded by screwdrivers and different bits. We washed our hands and now each of us touches the case in turn to drain away static electricity. Likai has a humidifier bubbling and puffing a meter behind him just in case. Zhan Nima puts away his phone, tutting, "Winter break..."</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Lily asks. Nima bats a hand. Lily shrugs. "Okay! Where do we---"</p>
<p>"Whoa!" Voices come from the door.</p>
<p>I look over. I thought the school’s empty in winter. Billy, Rubik, Robbie, Lindsay, Iris, Tina, and Sally all look in. Rubik points out the pile of parts excitedly to Billy, whose same face wears the usual small cold scowl when it’s at rest, and Robbie, who whistles. Tina is tapping at Sally and looking around at Lindsay and Iris. I palm my face as they all walk in and take a seat by the door.</p>
<p>"Motherboard." Nima decides to ignore them and prods me. I hand it over. "Manual." Lily spreads it open before us and clasps her hands. "Okay, let's read."</p>
<p>"Oh." Rubik stands up to leave. "I thought you guys are going to build it."</p>
<p>"You need to know the layout before starting." Robbie tugs him. "It's a manual for how to build the computer."</p>
<p>"Oh." Rubik sits back down.</p>
<p>"No pressure. We put in the CPU first." I say. "'Align the arrows on the CPU and the socket.'" I point to the gold triangle on the chip. Likai unbuckles the lever and opens the hatch. Then he realizes he forgot to touch the case. He makes a hasty reach for it, stealing a guilty glance at us. It should be fine. He plucks the 9770x out of its tray and poises the chip over the socket, "as flat as possible," as the manual indicated. He lowers it slowly. The gang by the door watches with bated breath. "Uh, you don’t need to be too careful, ya know? Just put it down."</p>
<p>So he does. Then he chugs down a bottle of water and lets Lily close the hatch. Lily pushes the lever back in place and the black cover pops off. Likai almost chokes. The gangs lets out an "ooooh!" I thought I even heard Billy's voice. Sally is arranging Billy's face into a worried frown. "Poker face!" She whispers.</p>
<p>"Is it supposed to do that?" Likai asks. I point at the line that says "Make sure the black cover plate is always in place until it pops off when closing the socket lever."</p>
<p>"'Read the fucking manual.'" Nima chuckles. "It used to be much more unnerving, back when they had pins on the CPU. Bend one and you'll be straightening it all day."</p>
<p>"Great!" Lily high-fives Likai's sweaty palm. "Cooler next?"</p>
<p>"Let's do RAM next." Nima flips through the pages. "We have a water cooler, and its tubes would get in the way. We'll do that after the board is in the case. Okay, RAM. Short term memory for the system. It's like this floor where we're keeping the screwdrivers as we work, versus the storage disk, which is the closet we store them in when we don't use it. We have four slots but two sticks. So we---"</p>
<p>"Whoa!" Lily's friends, Mae, Julia, Landon, and Max, come in. Ye Xin and Lyka pass by behind them, and then backtrack to look in.</p>
<p>"Eh? Why aren't you home for the break?" I blink.</p>
<p>"Lily isn't." Landon beams.</p>
<p>"Can we watch?" Mae smiles from behind Max. Ye Xin and Lyka nod expectantly, too. Likai looks at the six people already there and sighs. Whatever. Can't refuse Mae.</p>
<p>"Hey, at least they asked." Lily wiggles, beckoning Mae and Julia over.</p>
<p>"I didn't know my dorm can hold so many people." Likai muses. "All by the door, no less." The room doesn't have much to begin with, other than the standard-issues for Willowcreek Academy: two wooden chairs, a desk, a bed, two stands, and a wardrobe, all painted white. Then there's a blue fabric couch and a black metal bookcase, on which stand many Lego cityscapes. Likai added a TV stand and a TV. Winter morning sunlight pours in through the two windows, one by his bed and one above the couch (through which Lily just looked in). It spreads across the Baldur's Gate poster above the desk and the calligraphy piece above the TV, lending them a layer of vibrancy.</p>
<p>"Big hearts make for big rooms." Max says.</p>
<p>"Uh-huh." Nima sticks the RAM in Likai’s hands. Likai studies the manual for the correct slots, and lines up the notch of the stick to one of them. He sets it in, glances at us, and pushes. It didn't go in. He pushes again. It stays sitting there, askew.</p>
<p>"Don't be coy. Put all your 180 pounds to it!" I say. <em>Chek-chek-chek-chek.</em> We all look at the source of that sound. Sally and Tina are shaking two maracas each. "... where did you get those from?"</p>
<p>"Go Likai go!" They call, giggling. Likai puts his back to it. Th slot goes CLACK as the levers catch. A bead of sweat rolls down his temple. He takes a long swig and motions for Lily. Lily slaps the other one in before Tina and Sally even started rattling. She slaps Likai’s outstretched hand for another five,</p>
<p>"Teamwork!"</p>
<p>"Hmm that's my girl." Iris laughs.</p>
<p>"And mine." Lindsay laughs identically.</p>
<p>"The SSD's next, right?" Julia wags her chin at it. "I remember Landon showed me when he built his. That's like the only thing left besides the graphics card."</p>
<p>"The solid-state drive. Yep. Much faster than the old spinning disk drive, and much smaller, too." I pop it out of the container.</p>
<p>"Look how cute it is!" Lily exclaims to Mae and Julia. "It's tiny."</p>
<p>"It is." I say. "No DRAM, though. That's RAM on the drive for its own use. Supposedly makes it faster in some intense work like the 3D modeling Likai does in architecture class, or video editing. But it should be fast enough nowadays that you won't notice a difference."</p>
<p>"Yeah, should be fine. I don't see any improvement on my computer." Nima says. "Too bad we have only one, though. This board can take three."</p>
<p>"No money." Likai grunts. He screws it down, and then lays a thermal pad on top. With Lily's help, he secures the heatsink. Lily high-fives him again.</p>
<p>"Into the case this goes." Nima says. "Then the cooler and the GPU."</p>
<p>We flip the chassis sideways. Lily clears the cables and wires inside while Mae and Julia sort through the bag of screws it comes with. We put in the standoffs and check whether the motherboard is oriented the right way.</p>
<p>"Whoa!" Rowana gasps from the door.</p>
<p>"We should just shut that." I say, exasperated. "It's like we're a circus or something."</p>
<p>"Oh don't mind us. We'll be quiet as a mouse." Rowana grins. She tiptoes in with Sparcal, Aura, Ela, and even Old Nar'fiius. The headmaster makes himself comfortable beside Billy and chuckles.</p>
<p>"What were we doing again?" Likai sweats. With all the people (and elves), the room is getting warm. "Please don't tell me you got more of your characters coming over."</p>
<p>"It's after breakfast! We're in a dorm! What did you expect?" Lily throws out her arms. "Come on! Let's mount it---oops!" In her enthusiasm to help him, she accidentally slid his finger on the edge of the motherboard I/O shield. But Likai is steadfast. He persists to snap in the shield to the case, slide in the board, and twist in the screws before checking the cut. "Sorry! I'm sorry!" Lily busies herself with dabbing way the blood on the case, the shield, and the screwdriver. "I'm so sorry!"</p>
<p>"Anyone got bandages?" I ask. Aura is already walking over, and Landon, too. He leers at the bloody tissue and Likai's finger, and wags his left pinky at Julia,</p>
<p>"Yeah, I've paid that blood sacrifice, too. Remember this?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh. We both did." Julia raises her right ring finger.</p>
<p>"So have I." Nima shows his right index finger, a faint scar upon. "Look at that. Pretty deep, too."</p>
<p>"Oh I feel all left out." I pat Likai's thick shoulder. Aura closed his cut well. It's barely visible once the blood is cleaned. "Welcome to PC building. You've be hazed---Ow!"</p>
<p>He prods me in the side. Guess he isn't nervous anymore. I push the cooler toward him. This is the only part that I've never laid my hands on. Unlike traditional air coolers, this has not a heatsink but a cylindrical water block that goes onto the CPU.</p>
<p>"Where's the liquid?" Lily asks.</p>
<p>"It's already in there." Nima traces a finger along the tubes dangling from the water block. "There's a small pump inside that cycles the coolant through these. The heat from the CPU would be absorbed by the coolant and carried to the metal radiator, and dissipated through those fins by the fans. If you want to go fancy, you can add a custom reservoir and replace tubes with pipes"</p>
<p>"No money." Likai grunts. "Maybe some time in the future, as an upgrade."</p>
<p>The first step is to stuff a rubber seal to a bracket under the water block. It really shouldn't be a step if the manufacturer didn't decide to design two separate mounting brackets for different brands of CPUs and make the user assemble the one they need. <em>But it’s a budget brand,</em> we tell ourselves, <em>deal with it.</em> Lily, Mae, and Julia team up, one holding the bracket, one holding the water block, and one fitting the seal. The bracket bends as if to break, but the seal remains immutable. It slips and slides and refuses to sit still. When one side is pressed down, a different side flips up. The crowd by the door are a little too quiet. I half expected them to start the maracas, so I look over.</p>
<p>Oh they'll start the maracas alright---and more than that. Ela is handing out poms and Rubik is blowing up cheer sticks for Iris to pass around. Old Nar' procures a pair and chuckles, "Oh my, I do hope this does not speak to how little entertainment my school has to offer."</p>
<p>"It's Winter Break, grandpa." Iris pouts. "This <em>is</em> entertainment. Ready, everyone?"</p>
<p>The cooler changes hands. Likai rolls up his sleeve and wrangles the seal with Zhan Nima. The crowd chants, "Zhan Ye! Bro Kai! Zhan Ye! Bro Kai!" Lily and Julia follow up with "Stuff it! Go! Stuff it! Go!" I rest my chin on my folded hands, thinking that were we alone, curses would be flying already. Lily wrings my arm up, yelling,</p>
<p>"Don't just sit there, Liuy! Even Billy's cheering!"</p>
<p>The guy with a resting scowl on my face stretches his lips as his way of a grin. Sally and Robbie are wringing one of his arms each as well. His eyes have that defeated look, which says, "I'm here 'cause my friends kidnapped me here," "If you can't defeat 'em, join 'em," and "Haha serve you right for creating Lily that way."</p>
<p>I did <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>In the rhythmic rattles, dancing glitters of poms, and the bubbling of the humidifier, I escape Lily’s clutches and pin down the bracket with Nima while Likai fights against the silicone seal. The struggle drags on and the distant bell strikes ten times. The tower bell was cracked earlier in the year and we had to use elven arts to get it out and put the new one in by shrinking and restoring them. Hey---What if we just have the elves enlarge this slippery bastard and then shrink it with their elven arts? But they are too busy hooking up a stereo to Rowana's phone. She taps it and the stereo goes, "Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick."</p>
<p>"...If you guys are <em>really</em> bored, help us, maybe?" I say. The four younger elves shake their heads and laugh their silvery laugh.</p>
<p>"Nah."</p>
<p>The seal jostles and jumps and jolts around. Damn this thing. Time for some drastic measures. We hold down the bracket and notch a finger from each hand to the fucking seal. At Likai's mark, we stretch the mafa and pin down the bracket with both hands. The bracket creaks and groans. Our fingers, the seal, or the bracket: one of them is breaking today. Rowana slides a finger up on her phone. The timer ticks louder and louder, until by a miracle, the seal snaps into the groove around the bracket.</p>
<p>"Phew. Thanks for the... <em>support</em>?" Likai wipes his forehead and bows his head to the crowd, left palm over right fist. In the rowdy cheer, Nima and Lily install all the fans to have the air come in from the front and below, and out through the top and back. I put in the radiator. Likai peels off the plastic on the water block, makes sure the thermal paste is there, and mounts it to the CPU. He reaches for the GPU.</p>
<p>"Oof, this is heavy!" Mae gingerly passes it over. They overbuilt the heatsink in this generation. The cards are big for no reason, and sell for an obscene price. Once that's in, Nima holds up the power source.</p>
<p>"You sure about this?"</p>
<p>"Too late to change." Likai shrugs.</p>
<p>So into the case it goes, and we connect the cables, routing and arranging them along the way. First are the USB-C header cables and the power button wires for the front panel. Then come the case fan and the AIO cooler fan cables. Finally are the power cables: 24 pin ATX for the motherboard, 8 pin 12V for the CPU, and the 12V HPWR to the GPU. Thank god we don't have peripherals like 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch storage disks. It'd make organizing the cables much harder. The end result looks delightful: all the individual cables bend neatly to the back of the motherboard, where Nima used velcro to tape them down flat. Not a single stray cable goes across the motherboard, only the tubes of the cooler. Likai breathes out a satisfied sigh. The gang by the door hoots in cheer.</p>
<p>"Where's your monitor? Let's light it up." Nima says.</p>
<p>"It hasn't arrived yet. I meant to build this on Saturday, when it gets here."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Whoops." Lily says.</p>
<p>"TV should work, too, right?" Tina points.</p>
<p>Yeah. We move over. Likai pulls out a Display Port cable and plugs it in. I plug in the power. Nima flips the switch on the power source. Lily looks the whole thing over and asks which port the DP cable is supposed to go in again. We quickly switch it from the motherboard port to the GPU one.</p>
<p>"Good catch." Nima laughs. "Light her up, Bro Kai!"</p>
<p><em>Click</em> goes the power button. A spark flies out of the power source. The crowd gasps. I give Nima a look and stare at the PSU. Wisps of smoke snake out of the grill.</p>
<p>"Oooh!" The gang gasps louder.</p>
<p>Zhan Nima wrenches off the power cord. Likai collapses into the couch. His long sigh trails around and around the room. Silence falls over the gang. They look at each other, wistful, sorry, disappointed, or upset. A gust of wind whistles against the window. It brings in eleven chimes from the bell tower. I heave a sigh and collapse into the couch, too. The dead, stuffy air is punctured only by the bubbling and puffing from the humidifier.</p>
<p>Old Nar’ finally speaks,</p>
<p>"Likai, would you like a technician to look at it?"</p>
<p>Likai raises an arm and waves.</p>
<p>"Nah. Liuy and Zhan Ye warned me about this. It’s karma." He stands up, a hand on his stomach. "Thanks for coming. I’m hungry. Lunch. Let’s go for lunch. C’mon, Liuy. Zhan Ye---Zhan Ye? C’mon, drop your phone already."</p>
<p>Zhan Nima holds up a finger, muttering, "Hold a sec." He slips his phone into his pocket and starts unplugging the power cables. "Liuy, come help." A smug smirk crawls onto his face. I look at him in askance. He only replies, "Heh heh."</p>
<p>I take off the dodgy power source. Its metal casing is warm, and it smells like burnt plastic. Nima points at one of its socket. Melted. I pass that around. Together we examine for damage on the motherboard. Without an ampere meter or a technician, we can't tell much. At least all the power sockets on the board and the GPU look fine. Nima throws aside the cables and lie down on his back, tapping away the seconds.</p>
<p>"Uh… what are we waiting for?" Rubik pipes after a while.</p>
<p>"For Bro Kai to get back from the toilet. Also, I had someone look for a store that’s open before we started building." Nima says to the ceiling. "Just in case."</p>
<p>There’s a knock on the door frame. A long-haired girl leans in. She holds a plastic bag that says "MacroMarket". I don’t think I’ve seen her in the school before, even though she looks our age. <em>Part-timer at this time of the year?</em> I think. <em>What a hard worker.</em></p>
<p>"Sorry, is Zhan Zhiquan here? Um… I have something for him…" She hesitates and looks around the room. Nima shoots up, beaming.</p>
<p>"You came!" He exclaims. "Thanks---thanks!" He runs to her. The girl hops a little on the balls of her feet and pouts,</p>
<p>"You really had me running around! MacroMarket wasn’t open ‘til 10:30, so I had to go the long way around and visit other stores first. But none of them carry this---" She thrusts the bag forward. Likai comes out of his bathroom and mouths to me, "Who is she?"</p>
<p>I look at Lily, and she looks equally nonplussed back at me. Old Nar’, the only other one who’s omniscient in this world, tilts his head at me, and then looks at Nima and the girl with his usual peaceful smile.</p>
<p>"Oh right. Everyone, this is my girlfriend." Nima leads her into the room.</p>
<p>"I like her." Lily smacks her hands together. "She’s the only one in the past two hours who didn’t go ‘Whoa!’, but knocked." And that’s how you crack apart the heavy atmosphere in the room. The girls reach for Nima’s girlfriend and takes over her coat. They make room for her, welcoming and commending her effort.</p>
<p>"I’m used to it. Zhiquan drags me around town every other week to find one part or another. You know, engineer specialty student and all."</p>
<p>"Heh heh. And <em>that</em> might have just saved Bro Kai's PC." Nima struts over, grinning. He takes out the new top-of-the-line Privateer JK850x Platinum and holds in the sunlight. The elves in the room missed an opportunity to sing those angelic "ahhh"s for the effects. After another check, Nima presses the power button.</p>
<p>Nothing. No lights, no screen display, and no fans spinning. Not even a click.</p>
<p>"Aww..." The gang groans.</p>
<p>"The motherboard's fried, I guess." Nima sighs.</p>
<p>"Then why isn't the PSU fan spinning?" I ask.</p>
<p>"Privateer's units have a 'zero-spin' mode for noise control."</p>
<p>"It should still spin up on boot, shouldn't it?"</p>
<p>"Hmm... I guess?"</p>
<p>"Lunch!" Likai stands up again and makes for the door. He looks serious---for lunch, at least.</p>
<p>"Hold on!" Lily flips the switch on the PSU. She checks the DP cable again and makes sure the power button wire is secure. She extends a hand to the PC. "Do the honors, Likai!"</p>
<p>"Nah. It's probably---"</p>
<p>Lily takes out a pen and poises it over her palm.</p>
<p>"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't use that authority after scolding me for it last year." I snatch her writing hand. Nima's girlfriend looks puzzled and alarmed. Others in the gang pick up the maracas, cheer sticks, and poms, smiling their encouragement and anticipation. Nima leans over and reaches for the button, but Lily stops him with a glare. Likai shrugs and strides over. In the renewed "<em>Chek-chek-chek-chek</em>" and "<em>Bung-bung, bung-bung</em>" over the bubbling and puffing of the humidifier and the whistling wind, he jabs the button. <em>Click</em>. All sounds cease. Fans whirl up and then die down to a soft hum, giving way to the low pump of the liquid cooler. The TV lights up with the logo of MSB. The circle spins until everything is replaced by the BIOS.</p>
<p>The humidifier bubbles and puffs. Then it splutters its last bit of water and shuts off. That is all.</p>
<p>Landon is the first to clap. Rubik yodels and drums a lively beat with his cheer sticks against Billy's. The gang explodes. "Likai! Likai! Likai! Likai!" They shout. Lily leaps over and high-fives Likai again, and then to Nima and me. I slap Likai's thick back, and nudge his arms for good measure.</p>
<p>"We just hit every mistake we could make today." I laugh at Nima.</p>
<p>"Heh heh." He replies. "Oh didn't we."</p>
<p>"All's well that ends well!" Lily pipes up. "Fun!"</p>
<p>"Why aren't you laughing?" I hear Sally and Tina ask Billy.</p>
<p>"He <em>is</em> laughing." Lindsay says.</p>
<p>"I <em>am</em> laughing." Billy says.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Thank you." Likai regal-waves a hand at the gang. "Thanks for the support. Thanks for swinging by. Thanks for saving the day. Than--- <em>Oi</em>!"</p>
<p>The guys rush him and to my amazement, lift him overhead. The girls join in, too. Together, the elves and humans, fictional and real, carry him out through the door and probably to lunch, or maybe Willow Creek for a victory dunk. "<em>HE BUILT A PC! HE BUILT A PC!</em>" They storm down the hallway. Lily follows Nima out of the room to chase after them. I take a last look at the blinding bling of an RGB by the TV, and shut the room door.</p>
