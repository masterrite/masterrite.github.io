    <p>The Chapel is not much of a venue for religious practices—in fact, it’s not one at all. Behind the stereotypical Greek hypostyle facade of an entrance is a much wider rotunda. Three more entrances are annexed to the east, west, and north of this building. Inside, the corridor runs around half of the circumference, opening six doors in total to the great hall. In the busy and noisy crowd, Likai and I flash our IDs to the usherers, and make our way in. Some of these people are students, either graduating seniors or those who didn’t leave early after the finals. Most are outsiders—parents of the graduating class and residents from the town. Five dollars aren’t remotely expensive for a ticket (and to be frank, we gave away more than we sold). Yet many still choose to grace us in their best suits and dresses, old and young alike, a bow tie here and a jeweled brooch there. Not because of the elven students in the performance, it’s the school. Community outreach, giving back, moving out of the bubble, you get the idea. Willowcreek Academy is an integral part of the town.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Likai makes way for the yawning main door. I grab his thick arm and notion at the staircase.</p>
<p>“Let’s leave the floor to the ticket holders!!!” I yell in the din.</p>
<p>“What???” He yells back.</p>
<p>So I hoist his arm over my shoulder and march up the carpeted steps, keeping a low profile when I can. We squeeze our way past the same bright orb lamps floating in their brackets of twisted brass vines, red velvet carpets, gilded portraits of notable alumni and staff members, chalk statues of musicians, yada yada. The crowd didn’t thin until the fourth-floor gallery. Through the single, closed door I slip in and stumble. —Holy hell, I haven’t expected the top-level balcony to be this high up and steep. The floor slopes 70 or so degrees downward, and if I sit down, the seat in front could cover up only to my ankles. I tumble down to the first row. Likai, puffing from all the stairs, crashes into the next seat. The door shuts the din out.</p>
<p>“What the—heck, man.—Why here?”</p>
<p>“Great view.” I grin, bouncing my brows. My palms and my stomach tingle as I peer over the railing, holding my glasses secure to my nose bridge. “Damn, this is like the VIP seats.”</p>
<p>Not really. We’re sitting right <em>atop</em> them. The third and second tier below are half-full already. Here and there I recognize familiar gaits and gestures and ponytails. More are filling in those wide balconies surrounding the stage and floor seats by the second. In contrast, ours is almost empty except for Caspar and his gang. The four of them are sitting under the only orb lamp in this narrow, steep hell that’s only 11 seats across and four rows in total, huddled together over Martha’s book. <em>Leaf by Niggle</em>, short story collection by J.R.R. Tolkien, from fiction section T on library third floor. The titular Niggle, the despairing artist who pours his soul into his artwork, dies and revives in the very painting. The book’s worth breaking rules for. They didn’t bat an eye at us.</p>
<p>“Great my ass. Can we even hear anything here?” Likai looks back to his program. In the dim light, he jabs a finger to the third page, under the “Keyboard” section. “Are you really ditching this?”</p>
<p>“Iris can handle it.” I watch as she smooths the hem of her black dress at the side stage and sits down at the harpsichord. She scans the audience but doesn’t look to here. I slouch down nevertheless. Nothing provided much cover. Likai doesn’t show his contempt but doesn’t hide his smirk, either. I mutter, “What are you pointing at, anyways.”</p>
<p>“Your—“ He splutters, gaping at the program. My name on there is gone.</p>

<p>Down below, Iris starts a slow, repetitive arpeggio: <em>do re mi sol do re mi sol do re mi sol do re mi sol do</em> and back down, then, <em>la ti do mi la</em> in the same pattern, and another variation, and another. <em>The Prelude</em> from Final Fantasy series. They say Nabuo Uematsu whipped up this simple tune last-minute during the game development, never imagining it to become a melodic icon. Usually played on a piano, the brightness and the clarity of the harpsichord makes it sound closer to its 8-bit original. This is her version of a warm-up, or rather, a <em>calm-down</em>.</p>
<p>“See, you can hear the stage fine.” I yawn.</p>
<p>Down on the second tier, Billy lets go of his camera. It hovers into the air and positions itself in the center of the hall. He then raises mine for test-shots. I hear Likai suck in a breath to speak.</p>
<p>“Just give up.” I cut across him, curt. “I can’t play tonight. They shouldn’t have dragged me in. I’m not even part of the orchestra.”</p>
<p>“…I was about to ask the ‘secret surprise ending’ on here.” He rustles the program.</p>
<p>“Secret.” I wrap myself in my jacket and pull down the hood. “From Royal Albert Hall.”</p>
<p>“Like ostrich, you are.” Likai raps his thigh.</p>
<p>“AC’s cold.”</p>
<p>A hand clutches my shoulder and sighs.</p>
<p>“Shit.” I turn, not surprised to find Lily. “How—?”</p>
<p>“I’m the outlier, remember?” She says, dry, even downcast.</p>
<p>Yes, the outlier of this world, where all of my characters and my friends’ personas gather and attend the Willowcreek Academy, a joint middle and high school. Lily becomes an orphan in this setting, since her original parents became two mere years older. People affected by such paradoxes are compensated. They can choose anything before having their memories and lives rewritten. Lily being the smartass—I mean, the smart <em>lass</em>—she is, was the only one to choose to retain her old self, and something more: some of <em>my</em> authoritative power, since I “trashed her own story”.</p>
<p><em><strong>I did not</strong></em>. I’m just not skilled enough to finish it, yet. But I wagered then that it was one way to keep me in check, so she became the outlier on the power tier.</p>
<p>“Look, I really can’t—“</p>
<p>“It’s chilly up here, Liuy.” She rips off my jacket and swings it over her dress. “I’d rather not linger.”</p>
<p>The last sight I see is the schadenfreude on Likai’s chubby face and the four at the back looking up at our commotion. Lily wraps her arms around my midriff and kicks the floor. Over the railing we go, sailing down the VIP boxes headfirst to the third-tier balcony. Lily flips over at the last second. My knees buckle even though she absorbs most of the impact. She drags me down the slope, ignoring all the turning heads.</p>
<p>“No, not again. The stairs.” Then I add, “<em>Please!</em>“</p>
<p>“Unbelievable.” She mutters once we push through the door at the end of the balcony walkway. “Irresponsible. Unreliable. Laying off my story and now <em>this</em>!” Her voice raises by each word. “Well, Mr. Author? You’ve got the guts to wipe your own name off the program but you chicken out on the performance? Why not just write you performed like a pro, then, if you’re so keen to abuse your authority?” She stomps down the empty stairs. “Coward!”</p>
<p>“Sorry…”</p>
<p>“You aren’t the only one scared for his debut, and none of us had a choice.”</p>
<p>“…Sorry…”</p>
<p>We emerge to the latter third of the Chapel, where the dressing rooms and the backstage are. In the dampened excitement drifting over from beyond, Lily steers me around a corner, and we come face-to-face with Lindsay and Christina by the lockers. Three full seconds later, Lindsay sighs,</p>
<p>“Maybe we should’ve respected your reluctance, Liuy.”</p>
<p>“Technically I didn’t sign up for concertmaster, either, and I’m nervous, too, yet here I am!” Christina snaps. “If either of us didn’t want to do it the slightest, we wouldn’t have stuck around for so long, instead of bailing out <em>at—the—last—second</em>!” She emphasizes her last words with three shrill notes from her violin. Seething, she whips around and away.</p>
<p>“Ah well.” Lindsay shrugs and follows.</p>
<p>“I put his name back.” Lily calls after her and wrings me around through the labyrinth to the dressing room. There are people heading on stage with their instruments; there are stagehands rounding people up. There’s the choir group, from which Mae runs out to give Lily her wisteria garland back. They look awfully ready. In my mounting anxiety my eyes pick out Yifan weaving her garland into her hair, and she glares back.</p>
<p>“Don’t say it!” She knows what I always say (“big head”). “Wait. Are you alright? Is he alright?” She asks Lily.</p>
<p>“He’s fine, Fanfan!” Lily slaps my back and shoves me into a waiting Sparcal. “One absconded pianist author.” She runs off.</p>
<p>“…She still has my jacket.” I grumble, grabbing my dress shirt from Sparcal.</p>
<p>“Feeling well?” He calls through the curtain. I grunt. “Do not worry. You are not alone up there. Consider it a change of scenery.”</p>
<p>I usually am a stagehand moving pianos, helping with chairs, notifying upcoming performers, and sometimes taking over the lights and sounds. The volunteer job offers me physical exercise; it gets me to know the orchestra people; it grants me access to the piano in an isolated place. In the late evenings, after all rehearsals are over, and when the weather disallowed visits to the garden, I’d sneak in for the grand Steinway. If anyone finds me, I have my tuning kit ready, “for maintenance”.</p>
<p>That was until Robert found out. He didn’t buy my excuse. At least he was kind enough to wait until I finish before asking the entire orchestra to reveal themselves. They had been listening for days. The 62 people plus the director Mr. Gao coerced me to take up the second pianist role for the Graduation Concert.</p>
<p>I should’ve just written “I refused and left, and everyone forgot what had happened”. Music and its performance are expressive and intimate. Every note and gesture is an exposition, and playing before others makes me feel exposed and vulnerable. It’s an invitation to critique. I don’t like that naked sensation or the patronizations involved.</p>
<p>My cold and numb fingers fumble around my collar. Oh. A bowtie.</p>
<p>“Sparcal,” I poke my head out, hoarse, “help.”</p>

<p>The Graduation Concert is the longest performance of the year, and the last event of the Graduation Celebration. After five days of commencement, exhibits, social events, and the Banquet, the graduated class gathers from the Great Hall to the Chapel for this joint performance between the choirs from both middle and high school departments and the symphony orchestra. Over two hours long, two intermissions, three acts.</p>
<p>My part starts in the second act, but Iris asked me to be her page-turner during the first. Five minutes to seven, I push open the door to the stage a sliver. Furthest from me are the double bass, empty. The percussion stands by, striking a beat where he can in the <em>Prelude</em>. The brass and the woodwinds are echoing phrases from the strings, who are accompanying Iris’ arpeggio in full swing, turning the simple melody into a fugue. The choir is filing in before the giant organ, chanting according to the music. What started as a game became a full-blown off-script performance. People edge into their seats as solemn as they do when late for sermons. I check the highest balcony and can just make out Likai’s big silhouette. Caspar’s gang has moved down to the railing, too. I lift my foot, and Ye Xin yanks me back by the collar.</p>
<p>“Lyka told you to keep your garland in the afternoon, Liuy.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need one.” I say, automatic.</p>
<p>“Don’t break her heart, dude. Break a leg.” He runs the garland through my bun and gives a me a push.</p>
<p>Lights, camera, choir, low drone from the audience—too much, way too much. Notes stop making sense and merge into a thick blur, dripping over and off my ears, distorting the Chapel, eroding the stage. The chorus sounds hollow and muffled. I see stars.</p>
<p>“You made it!” Iris cuts into my head. I follow the voice and slide into my seat. Her faint fragrance fishes me out of limbo.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” I mutter, ashamed. “Sorry. I tried to bail.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got this.” She beams, tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear. “Warm up your fingers, Liuy. We need them later.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s in place. Old Nar’ in his white sweeping robes strides to the conductor’s podium, his hair a silvery-golden waterfall. He faces the orchestra, basking in the music, eyes closed, smiling. Iris stops. The strings and the woodwinds raise the volume for the climax. Chimes and cymbals start jittering with the drum. All sections of the choir open up their lungs in full. Christina stands up. The last, drawn-out <em>mi</em> hits and reverberates across the hall. I see Rubik sit with his jaw dropped to the railing on the second-floor balcony, and Billy stands in the back snapping away.</p>
<p>Old Nar’ lets out a breath, opens his arms wide, and bows to us. The audience dares not applaud. The silence is for Christina. She looks to us. Iris lays a finger on the key A4 and Christina draws it out on her violin. The rest of the orchestra follow in a sea of cacophony. Nar’ doesn’t turn around until Tina sits down.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” He says, a little drawling, as the applause ceases. He’s not loud even through the microphone, but his firm voice holds everyone’s attention. Nobody stirs. “Thank you for the beautiful prelude. Thank you for your dedication, and thank you all for joining us tonight, for our finale to this momentous, joyous, and week-long celebration. I do pray you bear with me and my voice for a while longer, with the hopes that you do not have to listen to me again.” He dips his head to the laughter and applause.</p>
<p>“Try and relax.” Iris whispers. “It’s your show later.”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what makes me nervous.”</p>
<p>“…I hope the seven years Willowcreek has to offer serve you well in your future endeavors,” Nar’ is saying, “wherever and whatever it may be. Use it as knowledge, or strength, or mere enjoyment as you call upon the memories, good or ill. Everything will be different the moment we part ways tonight, but fret not on the changing. Embrace them, and keep in mind the eternal: there is always time to take a break, to have fun, to let your hair down—“ Iris raises a jesting brow at my bun and glides a finger down her own. I pull a face. “—to know that sometimes, it’s a delight to indulge in informalities.” He lets the words sink in.</p>
<p>A brief silence and Iris whisks her head to me, eyes wide in disbelief.</p>
<p><em>What did he just say?</em> She asks me in her mind.</p>
<p><em>Second time today.</em> Some of my anxiety ebbs.</p>
<p>“Did he just use a contraction?”</p>
<p>Rubik’s carrying whisper is the first to ring out. The entire hall explodes into laughter and whistles. Old Nar’ chuckles and nods in my direction.</p>
<p>“How did you do it?” Iris claps with the crowd, amazed. The orchestra stomps their feet. “Not the authoritative power, is it?”</p>
<p>“No. ‘It’s a squirrel.’ That’s all.” I shrug. “I was surprised, myself.”</p>
<p>“Thank you again for joining us! It has been a delight. I hope you enjoy the performance tonight, and please, consider recycling our programs, or keep it as part of your collection. D.E. and Zea are spectacular artists and designers among our student body, and I highly value their art. Without further ado, please.”</p>
<p>Madam Yu enters and takes the podium. She shakes hands with Nar’ and then Tina. One bow to the orchestra, and one bow to the audience. She lifts the baton and her chin. Her black bun is tight. Her lips are thin. Her eyes are bright. Her entire posture demands attention and authority.</p>
<center> # </center>

<p>After so many times practicing and rehearsing with her, I’m still awed by how Iris’ fingers dance across the keys, light and brisk as the triplet notes themselves. Each emphasis in the rhythm is intuitive like speech. The lifts and falls of the wrists are graceful and controlled. For thirty minutes straight, she sang Bach’s <em>Wedding Chorales</em> and BWV 1044 <em>Triple Concerto in A minor</em> with her fingers. Muscle memory alone is enough for her performance. Why does she even need a page-turner?</p>
<p>I look at my hands. They seem too broad and stubby for a bony hand right now backstage. I washed and dried them twice, and they are still wet. I’m already forgetting what I’m playing tonight. Iris will be page-turning, meaning that I will be exposed to the audience, sticking out like a sore thumb in my white attire.</p>
<p>“Is this what <em>mian ru si hui</em>‘s about?” Lyka peers at my face.</p>
<p>“‘A face like chalk’? Yes.” Ye Xin replies. “Shall I call the medics?”</p>
<p>“Medics don’t give confidence boosts.” Iris shakes my arm. “Liuy? Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>“Ah—uh—“</p>
<p>“It might help if he had time to warm up.” Iris says. “Too late now…”</p>
<p>“I’ll make mistakes even with warm-ups.” I mumble. “And then I’ll make more after the first.”</p>
<p>“Did you notice the five mistakes earlier in 1044?” No, I didn’t. “Those aren’t really the only ones, and you know sheet well. The audience don’t. They have a harder time recognizing a mistake. Besides, you know your stuff, and that’s enough for you to feel confident for.”</p>
<p>“Eh—um…”</p>
<p>“I don’t get it. You’re the author. Why not just write you have an awesome performance? Didn’t you wipe your name off the program?” Xin raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“That didn’t get him anywhere, did it?” Lyka replies.</p>
<p>“But you <em>can</em> play! Go on. Just use it! ‘I performed brilliantly. The crowd—“</p>
<p>“Bathroom. Wash my hands.” I mumble.</p>

<p>It’d be unfair to everyone had I wrote that: to the orchestra members who rehearsed so hard, to the audience who graced us with their presence, to Iris who tutored me the entire year, and even to myself. I didn’t set up these pages just to cheat my way out. I guess to the readers, too. I can’t feed you all trash after the 3000 words you read. It’s poor authorship.</p>
<p>When I bow down to Murphy’s Law and rejoin Iris, where the piano has replaced the harpsichord, she looks quite serious. We both look at our knees.</p>
<p>“You know,” she starts, slow and thoughtful, choosing her words along the way, “I never look at the score when I’m on stage. It’s there so I can have someone I know sit with me. It calms my nerves. You have no idea how relieved I was when you walked through the door earlier.”</p>
<p>I take care not to look at anywhere, especially the audience. It’s rare to hear her so forthcoming.</p>
<p>“But for you,” she goes on, “I don’t think it’s enough. I know you can play well, so I don’t think this is cheating or unfair… it’d be unfair for you to practice so hard and not being able to show it off… Yes. It’s a safety net, not cheating.”</p>
<p>Without a warning, my head whisks to the audience. There’s Li Tong edging into his seat. Same row in the west wing, Jerry Liang catches my eye and waves with a good-natured smile. I see Rubik up above, wearing a smirk that I hope never shows up on my own face. Sally’s sitting in the first row of the second floor, frowning at the program. Two seats behind her is Sirius the Confident Bro, smiling at me like an innocent babe but reeks of coquetry, pointing to the bespectacled girl in front of him. The rest of my dorm mates are on the third floor, right in the middle, pointing me out and waving. Mike O’Bi’s iconic curve-eyed dimpled smile flashes from the east wing. Fourth floor balcony, Likai’s silhouette is joined by his dorm mates, and they’re either fighting or horsing around. Caspar and his friend seem to give them a wide berth. I smile for a brief second before I realize what’s going on. I turn to Iris. She tilts her head, listless.</p>
<p>“I’m glad I kept this as compensation.” She raises my arms and flexes my fingers through her telepathy. Lily told her a lot this afternoon, didn’t she. She reads that and smiles. “Look, I won’t be playing for you. I’m just going to catch your mistakes, okay?” I nod.</p>

<p>Madam Yu is back at the podium. The hum dies down. All eyes are on me. Lily looks nonchalant and non-expectant from her spot in the choir. Robert nods across the stage. I lower my shoulders and hit the first three chords, stiff. The keys are weighted a little lighter than usual. It’s going to be easier to slip and mis-press.</p>
<p>Some five minutes in, I don’t think Iris needed to catch a single error yet. I start to bend into my usual posture, and my mind turns from my fingers to the music. Beethoven’s Opus 80, Fantasia in C minor, or the Choral Fantasy, is a curious piece. Its four parts fall into two movements: <em>adagio</em> by itself, and the rest as the “Finale”. The <em>adagio</em> hardly suffices as a beginning. In the five minutes or so it presents little, if any, main or memorable motifs, nor does it set a tone or a mood for the Finale that’s three times longer. What is it there for? It stays true to the genre, I guess. Fantasies are free-form, and Beethoven can have his ending before the piece even begins, have it as long as he likes, and have it piss off the performer.</p>
<p>Iris catches me twice, redirecting my fingers to the correct keys. This is better than our rehearsals. I haven’t found the need to use the pedal to cover my mistakes.</p>
<p>Beethoven wrote this for his own fundraiser concert and played it himself. How rather ironic. I’m narrating in my own fictional world as myself, a story that did not have much of a beginning (but hey, at least <em>The Lack Thereof</em> sets a stage), and here we are at the end of the school year already. The end sometimes is a better story to tell.</p>
<p>But what does the Finale of the Choral Fantasy tell? For what it’s worth, it is very Beethoven. Capricious, intense, expressive, a pain in the ass to learn but very, very fun to play once mastered, and very enjoyable to listen to. For twenty minutes the audience is held by my trampling through the score, weaving in and out of the violins, and swinging from the serene to the stormy (very much like parts of his Sonata No. 17, <em>Tempest</em>) to the hopeful (the alleged precursor for <em>Ode to Joy</em>). You know, I think I can do this.</p>
<p>Last note. Applause. <em>Phew, I did it</em>.</p>
<p>Iris nudges my head with telepathy. I meet the approving eyes of Madam Yu before Christina stands up and blocks her from view. We are moving on to Beethoven’s Violin Sonata No. 9, Op. 47, <em>adagio</em>, the “Bridgetower”—I mean, the “Kreutzer”. The original dedicatee, Bridgetower, managed to insult Beethoven’s crush after the premiere of the piece over a beer, and Old B responded by changing the dedication to Rodolphe Kreutzer instead, who, as funny as it could get, refused to even play it.</p>

<p>The abrupt violin chords draw out my piano one. For nearly two full minutes we test the notes, tiptoeing around each other, cautious, holding back the torrent of—I don’t know—passion? Fury? Melancholy? Remorse? Pain? Insanity?</p>
<p>Iris usually drifts off when watching me practice this piece, mesmerized—or reminiscing? About what, or maybe whom? When she first mentored me over this piece, though, she was way too alert and uncharacteristically scathing. “Bland”, “tasteless”, “nonchalant”, it got to the point where she was upset enough to push me off the bench and hammer on the keys with a fury as though I had killed Rubik. When she banged her fist on the last note she yelled,</p>
<p>“That’s how you play it! Do you get it? Not that robotic tapping! Pour some <em>heart</em> into it! Don’t you have anyone you hold extremely conflicted feelings towards? Don’t you—you do? Play for them, then! Don’t just get the <em>notes</em> right! Get the <em>message</em> right, Great Mother God!”</p>
<p>I wonder who she thinks of when she plays it, or listens to it, to agitate her so? Does Christina think of someone as she tears at the strings with gusto? The piece is pretty fast for an <em>adagio</em>—</p>
<p>Something slips out of my mind like a sliver of ice. I become too aware of my fingers and the score sheet. The black bodies of the notes pulse and break loose, jumping off the lines like imps. I’m doing all I can to keep up. What just happened? Last few bars on the page and Iris hasn’t budged. I take a quick glance at her.</p>
<p>Her big, downturned eyes glare unfocused at the keys before her.</p>
<p>We’re way past the end of the page, and I can’t spare a foot to wake her or a hand to flip the score. It’s fortunate that the following bars are similar. If I close my eyes, my fingers can guide themselves, but what happens after that? I’m useless without the sheets here. What sort of a pianist doesn’t memorize all his sheets? I shouldn’t have been a part of this at all.</p>
<p><em>That’s one mistake.</em> I count. <em>Two… Not a third. Not a third—</em> Cursing, I snatch out a hand and rip two pages away at once. The third sticks to them a bit, and is left hanging, half-turned. The tattered papers fly at Iris, who jolts awake and straightens the dangling sheet. Madam Yu doesn’t react, but Lily standing across her looks startled. Under the eyes of 1,500-something people I miss three entire bars.</p>
<p>Christina looks over. I slow down, mortified. Why is a violin sonata leaning so heavily on the piano? Another wrong note hits me like a saucepan. I grit my teeth to stop my scream of dismay. The rule of thumb during a performance is never stop unless there’s an emergency; this is exactly that. Christina has to go solo for now.</p>
<p>Iris takes a deep breath. She raises an arm to the sheet and I shrink, face burning and legs trembling. Christina draws out each note to the fullest, forcing everyone’s eyes onto her.</p>
<p>“The Krutzer is a really good piece for improvisation and going off-tempo, but it has its limits.” Those were Iris’ words during our last one-on-one practice. “Be prepared to go solo and improvise, or get back to it fast when things arise.”</p>
<p>Who would’ve thought. I grit my teeth and hit the keys harder than I intended, and harder still. It’s the only way to suppress my trembles. We’re regaining tempo, but with every three notes there seems to be a wrong one. Iris hasn’t re-established her control. It’s for the best: a broken safety net from the start is as good as none. I knew it, and yet still relied on her.</p>
<p>Another few bars of piano solo with violin plucking. This is a violin sonata, not a concerto, for fuck’s sake! Why is the string an accompany to the keyboard now? The Chapel is swirling into a glob again, and the sheet is on fire. I try my best to curb the bubbling panic. The <em>adagio</em> refuses to stop; there are always notes coming after the expected endings. It’s annoying. No wonder Kreutzer hates it. Beethoven was a jerk to fall out with the only guy who cares about the shit enough to accompany him—</p>
<p>And it’s over. I almost black out. Thank god we aren’t doing the second movement.</p>
<p>Applause, whistles. Why? I keep my head down. Why are Madam Yu and Robert smiling? Hello? We just butchered the performance?</p>
<p>The last bit of act II is a rendition of the Finale of Symphony No. 9 to fit under 10 minutes. Even Fate sneers at me. I feel no joy, only icy shame. The Ode is meant to involve all member in the performance; Madam Yu takes it to mean <em>all</em> members—<em>both</em> pianists. Iris plays a four-hand with me. She covers up my half-assed attempt from the bass half of the <em>clavier</em>.</p>
<center> # </center>

<p>We crouch in a chilly corner, away from the others, Iris and I. Christina ran to the bathroom the first second after the bow and Iris broke down the moment she went through the stage door. Neither of us say a thing. People walk past us but I hid us both.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Iris’ voice is muffled in her knees. “I should’ve paid more attention.”</p>
<p>“…I relied on you too much, instead of myself.”</p>
<p>“I knew I drift off when you play that—“</p>
<p>“Had I memorized the sheet better—“</p>
<p>“I actually told myself to be careful—“</p>
<p>“Now I went ahead and ruined the show—“</p>
<p>“Are you two alright?” Lily drops down before us and grabs our hands. We all look like we’re about to cry.</p>
<p>“You again.” I turn away.</p>
<p>“It’s all my—“ Iris hugs Lily.</p>
<p>“Should’ve bailed completely—“</p>
<p>Lily pulls me in, too.</p>
<p>It’s bad enough as it is, and Madam Yu has to choose this moment to find us, all thanks to Lily breaking my spells.</p>
<p>“What’s going on here?” Her brisk voice slices us apart. “Why are you crying?” Isn’t it obvious? “I came for ‘good job on act II’. I might need a different spiel.”</p>
<p>“‘Good job’?” I blink.</p>
<p>“Yes, good job out there. Great Choral Fantasy, and very good handling of the emergency for a first-timer.”</p>
<p>“Choral Fantasy wasn’t me.” I tell her about Iris’ safety net.</p>
<p>“Ah. So you two solved more than one emergency in the past hour.” Madam Yu pulls over a chair and sits down. “Even more commendable. My job would be much easier if everyone is like this. As for the Kreutzer, Iris, it’s a loaded piece. Everyone get carried away playing it once in a while, let alone listening to it. I’m glad I don’t ever have to conduct it because of that. The fact is that you, Liuy, slowed down instead of outright stopping, buying Christina time to adjust and improvise, which in turn gained you time to reset. A suitable partner is crucial for more seasoned performers in that situation.” Madam Yu gives Christina and Lindsay a single beckon. “Good job out there, Tina. More experienced performers had worse solutions to that. Beethoven himself had to restart during his own premiere of the Choral Fantasy. His group was undertrained and he got carried away himself.”</p>
<p>“Thanks! Not bad for a first-time concertmaster, eh?” Christina looks around at us through her nostrils and flicks her long hair. “Probably first time that <em>adagio</em> is actually sounded like <em>adagio</em>.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes we get it.” Lindsay glances askew at her.</p>
<p>“I made too many mistakes.” I mumble. “Missed an entire row.”</p>
<p>“I doubt the audience knew.” Madam Yu stands up, a hand on the back of the chair and the other on my head. “From what you two told me, I believe Iris had stopped monitoring you for quite some time before her mind detached fully from yours.” She gives us a rare, thin-lipped smile. She presses my knee. “Unfortunately that means I cannot believe any reason for you to not give us a splendid performance in act III. Good job, all of you. This intermission is 15 minutes. Take time to refresh yourselves. I expect an equally good, if not better, effort in act III. Don’t bail.” She winks at me. I hang my head.</p>
<p>“<em>Don’t</em> refresh yourself further. Sally even told you not to drink so much!” Lindsay nudges Tina after Madam Yu leaves.</p>
<p>“<em>That’s</em> why you dashed to the toilet?” Iris asks, blank.</p>
<p>“Uh… what else do you do in there?” Christina pulls a face.</p>
<p>“Crying at the disaster.” I mutter aside.</p>
<p>“Who the hell cries in a shithole??” Tina slaps my shoulder.</p>
<center> # </center>

<p>I watch Iris take her place by the organ. Even at a close distance, she looks tiny compared to the 29 ranks of 401 crystalline and 1346 bronze pipes that are embedded into or layered over the entire wall. The organ used to be the stage itself, with its manuals and stops located right in front of the first row of the audience. It took a decade of performers’ complaints on the vibration and the mechanical noise of the pneumatic before Old Nar’ decided to rebuild it. It took another decade to tune it. A canal was constructed under the Chapel to direct water from Willow Creek over for the air required.</p>
<p>She’ll be back down after the first piece to take the white piano behind me. Madam Yu wants a stark contrast between the players and their instruments. Iris in black and I in white evoke the Taichi by sitting side-by-side, facing opposite directions between the black and white pianos.</p>
<p>“I’ll be alright.” I say to the organ pipes. Iris gives me a wink. The lights dim. In the round of applause and stomps, Madam Yu enters. Earlier the piano was at the side. Now in the dead center and the forefront of the stage, I’m right in the spotlight. But Madam Yu was right: I did play well alone for an extended amount of time. As long as I don’t mind any mistakes I make, I’ll be fine. After all, act III is the one I look most forward to. “Can’t worse than the Kreutzer; I did better than Beethoven.” I mutter, and wait for Madam Yu.</p>
<p>“Willowcreek Academy believe music is an indispensable aspect of life,” she begins, “and it’s our mission and pleasure to uphold that idea. That’s why we aim to bring music in its all forms to you through community events, masterclasses, and concerts.</p>
<p>“The rise of new media formats and methods of its transmission have revolutionized the realm of music, providing us a plethora of new choices. A majority of these are created as merchandises or their accompanying materials, of which artistic beauty takes the backseat and financial success is put to the forefront. Many may scoff at these so-called ‘tainted’ music, but we should remember that all of our classical masters created their <em>opus magnum</em> to garner favor and patronage from the aristocrats. In a sense, they wrote highly targeted commercials of their time. Schubert wrote the pop songs of his era; Shakespeare is a really bawdy bard; many early Chinese poetry are sung for entertainment in the fields. They survive not because they are meant to be unattainable or incomprehensible, but the exact opposite. While they represent their era, they connect human experiences across ages. While they each boasts their own skills of trade, they express simple beauties recognizable by all. While they require intensive knowledge to be parsed out in full, they do not require sophisticated education to be appreciated. They are fun and enjoyable. It’s these that make them art.</p>
<p>“Tonight, as our tradition, we wish to share some of such pieces from our own era. Let’s get down to earth, and take a gander at our own renditions of soundtracks from video games and movies, as well as pop songs. Enjoy. Have fun.”</p>
<p>Act II put her in a really good mood. Madam Yu pulls her conductor’s baton out of her bun and it falls into a long ponytail. The entire hall explodes into cheers and laughter. Old Nar’ in the front row whistles and leans back. Roldolf leans across Syereen to smirk at him. Madam Yu then pulls my bun apart, too. The garland cage unravels and flows past my shoulder. The audience cheers louder and Old Nar’ whistles again. I retie my hair, blending the garland in. The wisteria scent on my hands after calms me somewhat.</p>
<p>Right. Bring it on.</p>

<p>The noise ceases. A menacing set of chord progress from the organ. The choir inhales and bursts forth two forceful notes. I follow with a lengthy cadenza. The gong, the choir, the string crescendo joined by woodwinds and brass. The opening sequence of <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, a game that’s considered to host one of the best game soundtracks. Dark, brooding, ominous, the game opens on a snowstorm night with this in the background. The piece is a joint melody of the beginning of <em>Dancing Mad</em> and <em>Terra’s Theme</em>. This composition makes it easy for rearrangements: the foreboding <em>Dancing Mad</em> section repeats again after the gong and is followed by the more melodious <em>Terra’s Theme</em> in the form of a march. I join in halfway into that, gradually bringing it to a quieter and more ponderous version. Strings resurface to accompany my keyboard around the end, and one by one, the rest of the orchestra and the choir comes back to finish in the original march style.</p>
<p>There’s a modest applause; most of the audience doesn’t know if they should or not.</p>
<p>“Keep it up.” Iris whispers. I nod, my foot is still tapping to <em>Terra’s Theme</em>‘s beat. The air about her is quite warm. It’s good to have her back.</p>

<p>Tina takes her position again and waits. The high pitch of the piano, the low hum of the strings, the airy chorus, all ooze out and spread across the floor. Yuki Kajiura has the power to pluck the listener’s heartstrings with the hymn-like <em>a cappella</em> and the long draws of the violin. I consider <em>My Dear Feather</em> one of her best: the longing from the hymn and the strings contrast with the tension of the later percussion, and the entire piece reverberates with Beethoven’s passion in a much more well-restrained manner. The opening simply glides into the main body, rising with the chorus into the climax, a breather, as though the singer closes her eyes, and opens to the same turmoil, until everything breaks like the end of a nightmare.</p>

<p>The low double bass rolls on. I insert the lonely prancing notes from <em>Kokuyo no Kimi</em>, running the submerged tension for Tina to slide her cold notes down a long, slow spiral. Both of these pieces contain excellent-placed percussion, leading one section into another. The audience heaves a collective sigh when Christina’s fingers slide up and down the strings. It’s the cry of longing, bursting forth after the beats that had being kept in careful check. This feels like the Kreutzer, the catharsis of the suppression. There has been too much uncertainty in the ebb and flow of the piano and the violin. Should we trust each other? Should we open up? Does the other side care? Perhaps we should, and we do care. Our real feelings are unleashed in torrents overwhelming all self-imposed barriers. In a long sentence Tina rises up, higher and higher—</p>
<p>The string snaps.</p>
<p>Tina pulls a face at the gasp from the audience. Iris and I exchange a knowing yet relieved side glance. It’s fortunate it happens now, instead of earlier: the last few bars don’t involve violins. Tina flashes a grin at us, thinking along the same lines. She swaps her violin with an amused Lindsay, so she can continue on with <em>The Seventh Chapter of the Night</em> next.</p>

<p>For the entire piece Lindsay went backstage to repair the damage. She doesn’t miss much, anyways. Jay Chou’s songs are more suitable listening to than playing (poor Iris has this solo). I know she hooks up the new string with deftness, re-tunes it, and then spends the rest of the four minutes behind the door tapping a finger at the violin to JayJay Ji’s rapping.</p>
<p>Oh right. Maybe she misses JayJay rapping in his tuxedo. We don’t get to see that in the rehearsals. I wonder what this all looks like from the audience. A guy in formals with his elbow raised slurring Chinese as fast as he can in front of an orchestra is sure to be humorous, if not iconoclastic. The image is probably the epitome of Madam Yu’s speech earlier.</p>
<p>When Lindsay returns, Yifan steps down to the microphone. Her bangs are swept back, and I make a point to chuckle at her exposed forehead as our running joke. “Big head.” I hiss. She responds with a glare, and mouths, “horse face”.</p>
<p><em>Stop harassing her!</em> Lily’s voice echos in my mind.</p>
<p>Yifan throws me a narrow-eyed glance. I return in jest. It feels like a face-off. Too bad I can’t really one-up her and steal the show. Besides, I have to thank her for tolerating all the jest and wrong notes during the rehearsals. Others would probably quit already.</p>

<p>“Anata no koe ga,” She starts. I finish the rest of the lyric for her. The velvet bass and the crystalline treble blurs the the world. I like <em>Violet Evergarden</em> too much to stay lucid. <em>Michishirube</em>‘s beautiful, and neither of us need to understand the lyrics to appreciate the tenderness. Madam Yu isn’t conducting. Yifan’s vocals guide my tempo. The strings join, a drop of warmth in the bleak air. I wake up to Yifan striding to the piano, and twirling back with her arms wide. I feel my heart expand. I have to take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Is this what inspiration looks like? The extending and retracting arm, the improvised sways, the reflected glimmer from the garland and the flyaway hair. She spent much time learning and practicing the lyrics from Yidi. It all comes down to right now, when Yifan becomes the song. She looks like she’s having fun, on the stage, no less. I don’t get to see a lot of this during the rehearsal. Back there it was all a chore. Is enjoyment improvised? “Fun”, what does it mean exactly, anyways? In the bridging instrumentals she reaches an arm to me across the piano, head tilted and smiling.</p>
<p>It’s an encouragement, and an invitation to a friendly competition.</p>
<p>Madam Yu frees her arms, and I have a fleeting memory of Iris’ foot next to mine, teaching me how to half-pedal to extend the notes just enough but not slur them together. The orchestra splashes into life, and down goes my foot. The piano has never been easier to play. The notes escape like caged birds. <em>I</em> am escaping like a cage bird. Who needs score sheets, anyways? Yifan’s lungs open up in full, and I let my notes soar along her. There’s one slip, but who cares.</p>
<p>When the final note ends, I think I heard a sniff. In the applause I tease Iris,</p>
<p>“Are you sobbing, <em>senpai</em>?”</p>
<p>“Are you finally enjoying this, grasshopper?” She scoffs just enough for me to hear, rubbing at her eye corner.</p>
<p>I wipe my forehead, pouting at her. Before me, Yidi and JayJay switch Yifan out from the mic. Madam Yu readies her baton.</p>
<p>The Graduation Concert never had encores. There’s no turning back once you graduate. Cheer it, boo it, dream it, reenact it, draw it, write it in your stories; however much you wish for it, it’s over—pay attention and enjoy while it’s there: that’s the message. When this final song ends, the conductor will recognize the orchestral members. Everyone will take their bow, and exit. The lights will be back on and the usherers will open all doors, letting the summer night air extend its warmest invitation. Stagehands will start clearing the stage. If the audience still cheered, expectant, elven usherers like Sparcal will send them a telepathic nudge, though this has never happened before. Nobody resists the summer air.</p>

<p>So the baton dips for the last piece. The keys fall and rebound. Yidi sings the first verse, her voice warm and thick, unlike the usual bright and clear tone she has when speaking. Both hands cupping the mic on the stand, eyes half-closed, she sways a little, sighing the lyric, turning her back on JayJay, who has unclipped his mic and leaning against my piano, head bowed and arms crossed, casual, before his waist, listening,</p>
<p>“In the evening calm, twilight alone passes me by.” That’s what Yidi’s lyric means, I think.</p>
<p>The strings pluck, and I fill in for the guitar. Percussion, choir. The melody is vigorous and upbeat in contrast to the lyrics—I don’t think people would like it had we put <em>Michishirube</em> at the end, heh. It’s all about a great send-off. The guests are going home, the graduates are leaving the school, the students are departing for summer. “Summer is a happy season,” Nar’ always says, “and summer nights in particular.” You get your share of tears and tantrums, but always try to end summer days on a high note to remember by—and today we are providing that.</p>
<p>Jayjay straightens up to go about his verse. Yidi, who knows Japanese well, has pushed him hard to get all the pronunciations correct. She never cared much for the lyrics’ meanings, but vocal, as part of the melody, is a different matter. JayJay would engage in mock fights with her sometimes during rehearsal breaks, bouncing right after the music ended and blaming Yidi for being too strict, lean arms wringing,</p>
<p>“<em>Ou dao kai! Watashi</em> can’t do it!”</p>
<p>Does she fall for my idol, even a little? JayJay throws me a grin.</p>
<p>“Searching between the waves, I’ll try again,” he directs the words to Yidi. Iris and my clear-cut staccato gains traction and culminates energy. “So you’ll never have to be sad again.”</p>
<p>The surprise—the one mentioned by both Old Nar’ in the afternoon and Likai some time earlier, borrowed from Royal Albert Hall, remember that? Aren’t you curious what it is? I was scared witless from the height of my seat during my visit there, but in the end I didn’t regret any minute I spent trembling. I hope the surprise is equally worth it for you after the 7820 words you’ve read. If you’re a “high class music” aficionado, then you might have an inkling of what’s to come, and perhaps even the name of this song.</p>
<p><em>Uchiage Hanabi</em>, “Fireworks”.</p>
<p>At the upward flick of Madam Yu’s baton and the first note of the second chorus, flame and sparks dart out from around the bottom of the third-floor balcony into the center of the Chapel. The audience explodes into cries of surprise and wonder. I smirk at my reflection in the piano. Yes, people—Willowcreek Academy has its own indoor fireworks now!! The Chapel may not be as spacious as Royal Albert Hall, but it’s enough to host one. Red and blue sparks trail over our heads and explodes to our drumbeats. For forty full seconds they cackle and sizzle, but madams and sirs and anyone in between, across age groups, please, hold your applause, for the music and the fireworks cease, leaving only Iris’ piano, a slow and quiet afterglow.</p>
<p>The crowd waits with bated breath, anticipating what this round of staccato means.</p>
<p>Just when they expect the first note of the third chorus to burst forth, the orbs flare out. We all freeze. JayJay and Yidi switch off their mics and each dampens strings in Iris’ and my piano. The choir stifles. Other orchestra members mute their own instruments as well, but their hands maintained their last positions, poised to strike the next unsung note. The audience’s excited inhales are cut short. In the darkness, they dare not stir. We smile at their collected groan of disappointment, waiting for the cue.</p>
<p>Well, reader.</p>
<p>How would you one-up the Royal Albert Hall, when you already had a miniature replica of its ace?</p>
<p>What’s the one thing that place cannot do?</p>
<p>What’s missing so far in this concert that no one really misses during a concert?</p>
<p>A child’s cry. We admit all ages, but younger ones enter at a small price. I’m not sorry at all to say we place charms on children under 10 to ensure a disturbance-free performance. Nothing sinister—the charm makes only their guardians can hear them. It lifts three times: during the two intermissions, and now.</p>
<p>“Big brother Shanshan, look!” One little girl finally cries out. “The ceiling!”</p>
<p>It’s sliding open.</p>
<p>Royal Albert Hall cannot <em>open its ceiling</em>, people!</p>
<p>What, we have elves here, and you think we can’t crack open a ceiling? The quiet hum reveals the inky sky sliver by sliver. Here and there are stars. The moon is nowhere in sight. We hear crickets. We hear leaves. Can we hear the branching Willow Creek that runs under our feet?</p>
<p>Madam Yu swings her arm up and slashes it down. We slam the notes into the audience’s faces. Yidi and JayJay leap down the stage, into the audience. Fireworks rocket from the second-floor balcony up into the air. People screams in shock, then delight. That and their whistles join those of the fireworks; their eyes reflect the trailing light and showers; their ears echo with our music.</p>
<p>The piece is modified to repeat the last chorus once more, providing two minutes of chorus for the three-minute fiery finale. After that, the instruments fade away from back to front, section by section, leaving only the lingering piano.</p>
<p>Until then, we keep playing, fueling the memorable night and closing the school year. JayJay and Yidi activate the standard-issue rings on their fingers to glide down the aisles, beckoning at people, using its magic to throw sparks and bubbles over their head, singing, dancing, bringing them to their feet. Children bounce, tugging, excited, at their parents and grandparents. Some people clap to the rhythm, singing or humming along. Couples kiss. Friends hug. Everywhere is wonder and cheers.</p>
<p>This is the real Ode to Joy. I’m glad I part of this.</p>
<p>Old Nar’ adds his voice to the chorus, a smile of fulfillment on his serene face. JayJay levitates Jerry over to Yidi, who passes him back in a graceful twirl; I wonder how he would write about this show?</p>
<p>Second balcony, Sally weeps, hugging with the girl behind her. Confident Bro is trying to blow a kiss to the stage. That idiot never changes. Rubik is trying a shot with the camera under Billy’s instructions, same faces with opposite expressions. Maybe Billy will consider getting a drone now. That camera can’t fly high enough to capture the open-air Chapel in full (but he knows how to stitch panoramas from me).</p>
<p>Third balcony, my old dorm and O’Bi hold up their arms, laughing, pointing—why are those idiots chanting my name?</p>
<p>Fourth balcony, the fireworks bathe it in light. Caspar’s gang are swaying and singing along, hands linked. They’ll be old enough to audit for the choir next year. Likai’s dorm mates are the most stoic lot, lip-syncing to the chorus. I turn my eyes back and sweep the stage, from Lindsay and Christina to Madam Yu to Lily and Iris to Robbie, and the reflection of Iris in my piano. Our hands complement each other’s voices in the music.</p>
<p>Likai stands in his seat, hands on the railing, solemn. He has his triumph over me this time, and rightfully so. I don’t know if he still regrets being hoisted up there by me, though. I’m sure that’s a small smile up there.</p>
<p><em>The fireworks are spectacular.</em></p>
