        <p>"Well hello there. What's this?" Christina taps at a display case. It houses a few small, rectangular devices, about the size of a lipstick. White, red, blue, gold, silver, and black, all metal-built and boast a small knob wheel barely poking out at the top. On one side, there are three buttons, and on its opposite, there is a sliding switch. The side facing up has a glass-covered slit. This, Christina recognizes, is a hologram projector.</p>
<p>This is her first time stepping into the technology section of the depot in the Ereldar Academy. She wouldn't be here had Robert not took an interest in one of those "computers". Clothing and accessories---those are her only interests. All the wires and switches and plugs and screens and thingamajigs are boys' things, not for her. She was perfectly content to linger at the entrance and wait for Robbie like a bored girl. Perfectly content---until these "lipsticks" caught her eyes.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>"Should have worked harder in the Quenya class, hmm, Tina?"</p>
<p>Christina jumps at her mentor's voice, whose golden braid swings into view. Her eyes follow the strands up and meets the light chiding grin.</p>
<p>Tina tuts and stomps.</p>
<p>"Stop reading my mind, Aura!"</p>
<p>"More efforts in Telepathy Art training could have helped, too, hmm?"</p>
<p>Tina looks away, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>"Read the label. 'Portable music player'." Aura points at each word.</p>
<p>"Like a tiny gramophone?" Christina glances at Robert poring over a table booklet. Of course he has no trouble reading those elven letters. He's smart.</p>
<p>"Like a tiny gramophone." Aura nods and turning Tina's face toward her. "Remember to face your interlocutor, Tina." She sounds a little stern and exasperated, then goes back to an easy tone. "This is the latest design; I heard that the R&amp;D upgraded the processing unit. These can transcode more formats now, and handle larger libraries---"</p>
<p>"Whoa whoa whoa, master." Tina holds up her hands. "I just turned eleven and we don't have this outside!"</p>
<p>"Here's the older version." Aura sighs and pulls out a thin slab of metal from her pocket. One entire side of it is a glass screen.</p>
<p>"How'd you not lose this? It's even smaller than my palm!"</p>
<p>"When I go on missions, Tina," Aura crouches down and taps the screen. It lights up, showing an image of three buttons and a slider, "I like to browse the music stores, if they have one. I sample some of their music, and buy the ones I like."</p>
<p>"Is that where you disappeared off to that one time I had to pack everything up myself?"</p>
<p>"Tina, focus." Aura lays a hand on Tina's shoulder. <em>You were packing your own equipment for most part, too.</em> "When I get back, I turn the music into a language this player can understand, so it can play them back to me. That process is called 'transcoding'." Tina nods. Aura knows there's a question coming up on how transcoding works. She stops her with one upheld finger and continues, "If the world does not have a music store, I can also record songs with this, and play it back later." Aura places her palm under Tina's and activates the holographic projection. She scrolls the list. "These are called 'shelves', and inside them are the songs and music I have collected. We call all of these a 'library', similar to a real library. The size of the library is limited by the processing unit, you see. That is the brain of this player."</p>
<p>"How?" Tina flips the device over and over, holding it up to light.</p>
<p>"The more songs I have, the slower it takes to recall and display them."</p>
<p>"Oh I know how that feels." Tina hands back the device. "I can't recall the first Quenya words I learned, the more I learn." She taps the display case again. "So these can catalog more songs? Is that why they are bigger? Why do they have, like, <em>button</em> buttons, not like your <em>screen</em> buttons? What's that wheel for? How do you play music? How do you put songs in them? What does it sound like---" Tina stifles her mouth and stops herself from bouncing in excitement. <em>Her</em>? Interested in this "portable music player" thing? Really? Tina blushes.</p>
<p>"Oh? You find this device... what is that word you always use again---"</p>
<p>"<em>Cool</em>!" Tina can't stop herself. "I don't know why--- but it is! How much---?" She studies the label, brows furrowed. her wide eyes shoots around for Robbie, then back at the label. Her lips moves silently for a moment, making out the letters. "That's my monthly credit stipend!" She gasps.</p>
<p>"It was fifty years ago when mine came out. All those research and updates translate into the price." Aura shrugs. She stands up and takes a box from the shelf above the display cases. "Well, this is what I came for. Say, if you pass all your classes this term with 90%, I will---"</p>
<p>"I'll save up credits for this my<em>self</em>." Tina's blue eyes narrow at the display case. Then her head snaps to Aura, blushing. Her eyes flick to the box and back at Aura.</p>
<p>"Um... Can you---I wanna---I mean---"</p>
<p>"Let us go check up on Robbie, Tina." Aura holds onto Tina's shoulder, a thin smile hovering at her lips. "Then, yes, we can listen together for a spell. I am sure you will recognize a few of the songs." She shakes her head as a beaming Christina drags her to a waving Robert, a flat box tucked under his arm. Her students' joy and excitement, as aura often finds, are infectious. "Please stay silent when listening to the player, okay, Tina?"</p>
<p>"DEAL!"</p>
<p><em>Oh but of course she will not.</em></p>
