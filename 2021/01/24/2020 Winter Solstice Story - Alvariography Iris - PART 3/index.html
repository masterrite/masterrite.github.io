<p>Camilla didn't make it.</p>
<p>Her condition had never improved. When she was taken in, she had been in a high fever. The medics managed to contain it just under 39°C with antibiotics and their elven arts. They also monitored her heart rate and brain activity, both of which remained at a bare minimum. In the 48 hours after her operations, her fever lowered, her heart had failed thrice, and each time they revived it, the charge used was greater than the last. Fifty-eight hours after her operations, her body temperature tumbled below 35°C. Medics rushed into action, only to find the infection within her body had resurged. The bacteria had adapted to their drugs with unexpected speed, and was already enough to inflame and disable her medulla. Sixty-one hours after her operations, her heart stopped, and defied all medical efforts. Sixty-one-and-a-half hours, she showed symptoms of hydrocephalus. The medics struggled for almost another two and a half hours before Iris, unable to sleep well, got dressed and waded to the medics tent through the dark. No one was in the hallway. She waited outside the emergency room, and listened to the muffled shuffle through the flap. She sat praying. No one was ever religious at the orphanage. Madam Yu didn't allow it; she only believed in herself. The "Great Mother God" everyone swore to was a mere figure of speech. Whatever role she had in their folklore, she couldn't help now.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>So she prayed to Camilla, begging her to survive and get well. Madam Yu was already gone. Anne was lost. Fay wasn't here. Camilla was the only girl now: there were people that Rubik could never replace.</p>
<p>The flap swayed aside, soft and eerie. A human medic walked out, solemn. Iris thought he looked as if he hadn't slept for days. It reminded her of Lindsay the day they brought Camilla here. His lined and blackened brown eyes pleaded for Iris' forgiveness. Without a word the two of them entered the ER and into the side room.</p>
<p>Sally stood among the eight medics. Their white robes looked ghostly in the silent glow of the lamps. They bowed their heads at the glass chamber. Inside, Camilla floated in the air. Her skins had grown back, no longer a raw red, but a pale yellow. Her head was covered in the same manner as her body, with only her face exposed. Her expression, as far as Iris could tell, was not serene. So empty... The lack of hum and pumping from the machine was acute, slicing through the four o'clock drowsiness like a blade. The monitor was still. Everything was still.</p>
<p>Camilla's body sank through the air as though she was in water.</p>
<p>Five medics hummed a tune, low, soft, fuzzy like cotton, and the other four sang the lyrics, words of another civilization, another world. Camilla's body sank in the thick elven dirge.</p>
<p>Iris leaned against the wall and listened.</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>They buried her ashes---and whoever they could retrieve from the orphanage ruins---by an ash tree, the tallest Iris could find in the charm-protected camp. The loss finally sank in for Rubik, it seemed, as he lowered the marble casks into the hole and refilled it with earth, shovel by shovel. Iris hadn't seen him cry since his grandmother had passed---that tough old lady hadn't had enough left to bury.</p>
<center>
**
</center>
<p>"Do you want to pay one last visit to them?" Rubik asked Iris in the clearing. "When are we coming back, you know?"</p>
<p>Iris shook her head. They were leaving for the coast. Their ship leaves tomorrow. She didn't wish to linger. In less than a week, almost everything she had and had known were taken away. Too much had been lost. Iris had enough.</p>
<p>"Ready?" Lindsay came up to them. The sky was clear. The two armies hadn't fired for three days now. A gentle breeze was playing about around the budding boughs on the hilltop. It was a beautiful March day. So beautiful. So unreal. "One last look before we leave?"</p>
<p>Iris didn't mean to look up. Through the trees, the city ruins were almost picturesque in the sun, against the azure sky, though nothing had changed. The clarity and the contrast made the view look fake and staged. This wasn't the city she had grew up in. She gazed to the north. There was nothing to see, now.</p>
<p>"Right. Put these on, you two." Billy held out two rudimentary hairbands. "These are from the soldier's helmets. We dismantled Colaurë's controlling chips. Now all they do is protect your mind from telepathy."</p>
<p>Three jeeps parked in a row at the foot of the hill. Lindsay led Iris to the last one. Two elves with dark skin occupied the driver's and the shotgun seats. Elowen and Nix, Iris recalled, grandmaster and deputy of the Temple. She returned their greetings with a slight dip of her head. Rubik and Billy took the second with two more elves of gold hairs. Four more boarded the first. Sally came running down the slope, waving, holding a bag.</p>
<p>"For your arm." She stuffed it in Iris' lap through the back row window. "Stay safe---look after yourselves---one pill before sleep each night until the cast cracks---"</p>
<p>"Don't fret, <em>mom</em>." Lindsay beamed. "Catch ya later!"</p>
<p>"Seat belts?" Nix poked her head around. Lindsay patted both of theirs. She grinned, "Off we go."</p>
<p>"Take care!" Sally cried after them. Iris bit her lips. She looked out and waved her goodbye.</p>
<p>Sally disappeared behind some passing rubble. Iris sat back, mumbling to Lindsay,</p>
<p>"Sorry for all the trouble."</p>
<p>Lindsay shook her head and pressed Iris' hand.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before the jeep rolled to a stop at the checkpoint. Steel fences forced the vehicles into one line. At the end were soldiers, guns ready, going through cars and their passengers.</p>
<p>"Out of the car for inspection!" Iris heard them yell at their first jeep. The four elves obeyed. The soldiers moved in. As one, two of them ripped the helmets off of the two soldiers and threw them backwards. The soldiers bowled over the others behind while the other two elves dis-helmeted the ones that remained standing. The four of them moved in sync, disarming and disabling all eight soldiers in less than five seconds.</p>
<p>"Elves from the Institute sure are fast..." Lindsay whistled. "Can you Temple people beat them?"</p>
<p>"Can you?" Elowen gave an airy laugh and started the car.</p>
<p>"Five to ten seconds, but I'm not an elf."</p>
<p>They passed the checkpoint. The eight soldiers stood like puppets and let them go. The four elves saluted them with firm nods.</p>

<p>Iris must've fell asleep at some point. It was a shame; she'd never wanted to miss any view outside the city. She woke to a service area. "Desolate" was the only word for it. Their jeeps were the only vehicle in sight. The cement ground was cracked by hardy wild shoots of weed that had infiltrated everywhere, wiping the faded parking lines and lanes out of existence. At the far end of the parking lot, under the dead trees that marked the border, dried up weeds strangled a rusted artillery.</p>
<p><em>How did that even get here?</em> Iris stepped out of the empty jeep and stretched. It took her two years to learn how to walk but only two hours to forget. She flexed her legs and arm, and massaged her neck. On her left was the other border of the service area. Grass with dried-up stalks at shoulder-height fought their way through the wooden fence. Before her was the highway. Not a car in sight east to west. Across that was another tall weed field that, like Iris, had survived the harsh winter. There was a forlorn brick shed in there, its tiled roof just visible enough, inky smoky green among the dry yellow. It might had been a wheat field ages ago, or barley. Thanks to the war, Iris would never know the idyllic view of this place against the hill beyond, a view that had prompted the construction of this service area in the first place.</p>
<p>Iris sighed and stretched again. Behind her, two tarnished characters atop the low blue building with a glass front said, "Jiao Zhou". They were almost there.</p>
<p>From the tall weeds emerged an old man with a bushy, unkempt beard and wrangled hairs all grey and white. He reached into the stalks behinds him and lifted a thin, small boy over the fence. The boy hopped onto the cracked cement and helped the old man with another girl, equally small and famished. Only dust and grime on their faces knew the number of days they had wandered in the wild. The old man climbed over the fence with difficulty. The children steadied him with care. He chuckled and pointed at the building as though it was a toy store.</p>
<p>Iris entered the station after them. Two people busied behind the counter with pots and enameled mugs as the old man waited. The children hid their faces under his coats, stealing glances around the well-lit lobby.</p>
<p>People---refugees of all ages---huddled around in small groups. They sat on their dusty coats, some laid down and slept. Most had stainless steel or enameled mugs of noodles and soup. Some had their hairs wet.</p>
<p>Iris felt ashamed walking among them. It was only her luck that she avoided a fate like theirs. They weren't all lower class, either. Some of them had glasses. Some had jeweled necklaces. A few wore a posh expression and sat apart from others. People of all walks gathered, and she somehow became different.</p>
<p>The bathroom was clean. There were public showers next to it. This place had been long converted to a shelter. She found Rubik sitting with the old man and his children when she came out. He was joking and tickling the children, making them squirm with shrieks of laughter. She walked over.</p>
<p>"...trying to go as far as possible. Not enough, apparently." The old man blew at the noodle and fed the children.</p>
<p>"Surprised you guys hanged around there for so long." Rubik patted the children.</p>
<p>"Don't want to move, see. The farmer and his wife had to run in the end. Soldiers came kicking down the door because they didn't hand over what they demanded. Who could, with a winter like that?"</p>
<p>"So what now?"</p>
<p>"Rest a bit. Then to the coast, and try our luck there. Say," the old man glanced outside, "don't suppose---?" He leaned over and left the words hanging.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, grandpops. We don't have seats left." Rubik scratched his head.</p>
<p>"Ah..." The old man fell back, and then bounced up again, hopeful. "But you can have the kids, at least---?"</p>
<p>"No. Sorry." Rubik's voice was adamant.</p>
<p>"Rubik---" Iris glanced at the children's disappointed faces.</p>
<p>"No. We are leaving soon. Sorry." Rubik got up. He stood over them, thinking, and looked around. Nobody took note of them. He pulled out an envelope and set it at the old man's feet, and left. Iris, heart cracking, ran after him outside.</p>
<p>"Rubik---" She caught up by the fence. "I think we should at least---" Rubik shook his head. "The children can sit with Lindsay and me! We'll have them---" Iris grabbed him and turned him around.</p>
<p>Eyes wide and jaws squared, he whispered,</p>
<p>"Iris, that's us." He looked at the building. The old man and the children were blocked by the jeep, but Iris knew they were staring stunned at the checks in the envelope. "I'd rather them die with their grandpops than get separated. Know what I'm saying?" He sniffed and turned away, steadying himself. When he faced Iris again, he tried to grin as usual. "Well, at least they're better off than we were, now."</p>
<p>It was painful to watch. Iris never needed telepathy to know what he thought. She cupped his face with her hands and looked into his dimmed eyes.</p>
<p>"When we settle down in Japan," Iris murmured, slow, keeping her tone even, "we'll set up a small shrine, like m-mum did, for your grandmother, okay? We'll put it across the door, so she'll be seeing us o-off and welcome us back every day, okay, Rubik?" They blinked at each other. His eyes had always raised at different angles at each end. One of them had always had half a double upper lid. The mole at the corner had always been so small. She loved these eyes. Iris shut her own and brought their lips together.</p>
<p>It was the first time she had taken the initiative. Hoping against hope that nobody was coming back or could see them, she walked him up against the fence, blushing, leaning in, in, in, deeper and deeper into him until there was nothing in between. It was nothing like those frivolous pecks he had given her before. Iris was pouring all her feelings for him into him, to make sure he understood what she didn't dare to say, and that talking wasn't the only way to everything, and that when he felt sad, he could just tell her. He must have understood, for he reciprocated, supporting her weight and drawing her in at the same time, like a sturdy wall cushioned by muscles from all the chores he had done back at the orphanage. He atoned for all those lame kisses with this one, arms crossed around her back and hands on her shoulders, and breathed the only words he had never found confidence to say out loud. Iris could feel his heart, pumping out the minty scent she had loved so much.</p>
<p>They broke apart. It had been a strike on a bell, and the echoes reverberated long after. She felt like she was in a fever. Iris stared at him with her puppy eyes and her pouting smile. She had been crying too much. The expression felt stiff; unfamiliar. Rubik was stunned. He opened his mouth, shut it, and opened it again.</p>
<p>"For everyone, then. Your parents, mum, Big Bro, Cam---"</p>
<p>"Yeah, everyone."</p>

<p>"Eh." Billy grunted, looking at the skyline of the city. Their two jeeps paced side-by-side on the empty highway. Before them, a sea of bricks and concrete and steel wavered and layered: some surfaced and stabbed into the sky, and some was submerged beneath, unseen, insignificant. To the north was a slew of mountains. To the south were industrial complexes that hid the sea. Billy sighed and lolled his head outside the window. "Long time no see."</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Iris looked at him across from Lindsay, who explained,</p>
<p>"He's from this place back in our world."</p>
<p>"How long was it since his last visit?"</p>
<p>"Too long." Billy stuck his head back in. "To the seaside, Rowana! No luck looking for good hotels by the port, though, if this is anything like my home."</p>
<p>It was early afternoon. The city hadn't known much of the war, yet. As they rolled down the road, watching weedlands become farmlands, huts become hamlets, fences become trees, ditches become sidewalks, they saw people. City-dwellers chatted by their doors. They waited by traffic lights. They walked down dusty roads, thumbs in their pants pockets, pants that looked like what the Ereldar wore, and what they had given Iris and Rubik: the straight fitting, tough but stretchy things called "jeans". Children chased and laughed after each other in enclosed yards, or threw tantrum at one another, or lingered around flea markets that had popped up on the sidewalk, selling yellowed comic books and plastic guns, which Iris frowned at. This was perhaps how her city had used to be: a city in her memory resurrected by this one. They might have entered a new country already: the low hamlets grew taller as they proceeded, from mud houses to brick houses to stone houses to tall steel skyscrapers towering over a busy, bustling commercial district. The city was modern, fashionable, alive. Pedestrians wore bright, flashy jackets that Iris felt ashamed when she looked at her own plain, dull-colored monochrome of an attire. Young couples teased each other with octopus kebabs. Old people danced on the square across the street, swinging to an outdated tune blasted from a boombox. Cars drove past and buses stopped by sidewalks---they were driving much slower now among a real traffic of sedans, SUVs, small trucks, and, of course, buses.</p>
<p>Those flea markets became stalls and carts here. The windows were swung open wide, furnished with racks adorned in glittering jewelries, seashell chimes or conch shell whistles, and bullet-casing sculptures. Some were food carts. Iris heard sizzling oil and smelled grease, as well as whiffs of crêpe-and-fritters, fried sausages, and stink tofu. She rolled up the window to stop her mouth from watering.</p>
<p>It didn't stop her eyes from being glued to the large display windows of malls, however. Those white faceless mannequins scared her, but the clothes draped over them---bold dashes of yellow against stripes of red, gray, and blue---and the fluffy wool hats begged for her averting gaze. As well as the red, rotating advertisements signs taller than the trees. As well as the small flags hanging down from ropes that stretched across the street. As well as the functional, blinking traffic lights. As well as the roaring motorcycles. As well as the bicycles. As well as teens on skateboards. Behind the trees loomed the round silver dome of a building reflecting the sun. <em>A bookstore!</em> Iris' teeth chattered. That was what the red characters said up there: Book City. A building taller than the orphanage though half as wide, shaped like a quarter of a cylinder with a dome for hat. Iris forgot all her dignity and cranked down the window, craning her neck to stare until it disappeared behind the street trees again.</p>
<p>Lindsay gave a light snort, not unfriendly. Iris jerked back to herself, sorely embarrassed, and blushed at her knees. Lindsay leaned over. "Don't worry, we have time to look around. Billy'll be our guide."</p>
<p>"Will he?"</p>
<p>"Mm-hmm." Lindsay giggled. "He's ecstatic." Iris found it hard to imagine. Lindsay pulled her head into her arms. "Keep still for a bit---" Iris' heart skipped. Did one of Colaurë's men spot her? Their jeep turned and picked up speed. It sounded like the traffic had thinned. Iris heard a magnetic sound: the sound of wind passing through the woods back home, but slower, more rhythmic, intersected with shrill crows of birds. They stopped. All windows were rolled down and Iris smelled a cool, briny breeze.</p>
<p>"Stop suffocating her, Lin." Iris thought it weird for Rubik to call Lindsay in such an intimate way, but upon her release, the one hanging by the window was without the hairband, and wore a white hooded jacket over his leathered armour. She had never seen his expression so soft. He stepped aside.</p>
<p>The sea.</p>
<p>The greenish blue sea, rows of white waves racing for the muted yellow sand, one never catching up with the one ahead, smashing themselves against the dark outcrops dotted with gray oysters. White seagulls crowed low above the few heads of people swimming far from the shore.</p>
<p>"Are they serious?" Rubik tapped Billy.</p>
<p>"You should see them swim in the middle of winter. Fifty-year-olds here are tough old coots. Come on out. Let's stay here." He nudged his chin at the tall shiny tower across the road.</p>
<p>"You take care of the rooms. We'll look around." Nix laughed. Billy took up one of the two suitcases from the trunk and yelled,</p>
<p>"Sparcal! Come on!" The elf picked up the other trunk, chuckling at his eagerness.</p>
<p>"The Council would be mad if they didn't pay with telepathy." Rowana, who drove Rubik's jeep, laughed. Up close, Iris thought her slanted eyes, tall nose, and high cheekbones made her look haughty. The elf winked at Iris. "Oh, we dine and dash often when on errands."</p>
<p><em>Great Mother, she's also amoral!</em> Iris was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>"Come, wanna check out the sea?" She tugged Iris' fingers. Her other hand had already grabbed Rubik, who beckoned. Was she really an elf? The way she spoke had little of the formalities that Iris had found in others, even though her accent had that same elven lightness. Lindsay gave her a gentle nudge.</p>
<p>"Go on. Rowana doesn't bite."</p>
<p>The elf responded by nibbling at Lindsay's cheek. Lindsay shooed her away, playful.</p>
<p>Iris supposed that elves came in all flavours and had weirdos as well. Rowana let go of them as soon as their feet touched the sand. Under the eyes of all beach-goers she lifted her arms like lifting an invisible dress and kicked off, skating around the sand in wide, graceful arcs as though on ice. She circled around strangers, grinning and greeting, stopping them in their tracks, leaving them flustered and flummoxed.</p>
<p>Iris and Rubik strode down the beach and past the black line of kelp and seaweed. Iris picked one up, rubbing her fingers across the slippery rubbery surface speckled with sand. It smelled rather sickly sweet, but Iris couldn't help sniffing for more of it. Rubik went to the tides and cupped his hands.</p>
<p>"Nah-uh." Rowana skidded to a halt before him, spraying water and muddy wet sand onto the rocks behind her. "No drinking seawater, but you can---" She dipped a finger into the waves and stuck it in Rubik's mouth. Startled, Rubik fell on his back. His hairband slipped out of his hair. Rowana tilted her head. "Salty, huh? A cupful of that sucks all water out of you. Don't ask how I know."</p>
<p>A passing peddler raised an eyebrow at them, hesitated, and came over.</p>
<p>"You all want a net? For crabbies and fishies?"</p>
<p>"Net? Who needs that?" Rowana crouched down. The tide pulled away from under her boots, and out of a number of collapsed little holes. She rolled up her sleeves and pinched the air above one of them. As if being fished by an invisible string, a tiny crab rose out of the ruined hole into the air. Rowana looked up. "See?" The peddler's sun-tanned, stubble-chinned face froze as though struck by a brick. He turned and walked away, looking back at them, incredulous. Rowana's eyes narrowed at the struggling crab no bigger than the tip of Iris' thumb. "Now... what do I do with you?"</p>
<p>"Eat it!" Rubik pushed the hairband back in place.</p>
<p>"Let it go!" Iris flinched as Rowana twitched it at her face. Chuckling, Rowana rescinded her magic and let the crab scurry away.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't we be more careful, though?" Rubik looked around at the playing people.</p>
<p>"What for? You think I danced around those people just for fun?" Rowana stretched. She hooked a sensual and loving finger under his chin that made both Rubik and Iris blush, and turned his face out to the sea. Two military cruisers anchored halfway between the beach and the horizon. "This city hosts the navy. Remember those bullet sculptures back there? Colaurë knows where we are. The military is his eyes, both armies are, but the pedestrians are not. Now that his trap's set, he can't just attack and startle us away. The idiot is a strategist, not a tactician who thinks on his feet, as some of us are.</p>
<p>"So we just have fun and mock him for now."</p>
<p>The light, salty breeze played about Iris' hair. The seagulls rode the waves where no one swam. The sunlight spread and skipped across the rippling sea. It was low tide. Iris backed up to the kelp-seaweed line and sat down, watching the world ebb and flow before her, and Rowana hop over the passing waves, not at all concerned about getting wet. Rubik hopped with her, laughing like a child.</p>
<p><em>This is what life felt like without war, then.</em> Iris thought. <em>What a normal weekend would be.</em> Rowana was probably old enough to be their mother---great-grandmother, even. <em>How old is she? How old do elves live up to?</em> Had this been another world, another life---if there were other Irises and Lindsays out there, this would be the life she'd choose.</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>The city was similar enough for Billy to be a guide, and Iris learnt that it wasn't all glamour and shine. The dazzles were only as far as the southern coastline went. From the west-most tip north, tents and bedding showed up along the road. The area around the two ports, Port Major and Port Minor, were peculiar, even shabbier than those hamlets they had seen on their way into the city. Garbage piled by the foot of smeared walls enclosing dirt-covered, brick-tiled yards; low houses had windows either grimed or broken or replaced with thin wax paper; attempts of decoration resulted in pots of dead flower, their crumbled stems and leaves hung down the windowsill in pleas for help; the refreshing sea air became a stench more suffocating than that of rotting bodies. All of these only a wide, busy street away from the quaint dainty houses with well-cared-for gardens, relics of the colonial era. Iris saw the sneer on Billy's face.</p>
<p>"A gold-rimmed rag here, too, eh?"</p>
<p>At least she got to spend some hours in that bookstore after they had walked their legs off in the mall. Four stories in total, in addition to a basement level, selling all kinds of books imaginable, for children and adults alike. Iris had felt a more massive information overload than she had first saw the streets outside. Biographies, references on every subject, newspaper collections, magazines, travel guides, cookbooks, music critiques, music scoresheets, art, comics---they had an entire floor for literature, cut into sections by language, and then further by genre. Iris wondered if she should get Fay anything, and then wondered if Fay was in one of those dingy hostels by the Port Minor, where the ferries were. When they meet aboard tomorrow, Iris should lie about where they stayed.</p>
<p>The nightscape of the city was resplendent regardless of how much of a rag it was within. The street down below was a belt of golden stars. The skyscrapers only raised more stars closer to their nocturnal brethren. Roads in the north were a shiny cobweb in the dark. The sea in the southeast was further decorated by lights from the navy base. The waves rushed in and pulled out; the breathing of their world muted the traffic down below. Iris wished she could listen to it always---without the salty taste of the sea air, though.</p>
<p>"Good to see a smile on your face." Lindsay said, pushing their two beds together. Iris had taken off her hairband now that they were in their hotel rooms. For convenience, Billy and Sparcal had rented out the royal suite, the sole room on the top floor. The height of the building, combined with the protective charms laid down by the Ereldar, made the place impregnable. Lindsay and Billy each took a room with Iris and Rubik for extra security. "Tell me you had fun." Iris nodded, a little guilty. "Don't feel bad. You earned it." Lindsay knelt down on the bed and held her left arm wide. Her sword materialized out of thin air in her hand. She leant it against the nightstand.</p>
<p>"Did you have it on you the entire time?" Iris asked. The sword was peculiar, now that she got to see it up close. It was longer than those swords in Madam Yu's armoury, around a meter long. The pommel was a flat-cut sapphire, and the red wrapping on the grip resembled those on the Japanese swords. The ricasso was blocked by the sloping, gold crossguards decorated with black vines and leaves. The rainguard was two layers of pentagon-shaped steel screwed in, sandwiching the blade and set with a cut ruby. The blade thinned from the ricasso, and widened again by the end before tapering off to a thick tip. The wide, flat fuller from the hilt almost to the tip was in a dark red, and what Iris thought to be elven letters were inscribed inside in gold. It was a long and flat sword. No wonder Lindsay could use it to deflect bullets. How she was able to wield it so easily was beyond Iris.</p>
<p>"No, but I can summon it whenever."</p>
<p>They washed. Lindsay dried Iris' hair by draining out all the water with her hands. The ball of water floated in the air over their heads. Iris prodded it. Laughing, Lindsay sent the ball back into the bathtub. She dimmed the lights and started a quiet firework display. Dazzling and iridescent sparks sprayed from her hands into the air and down on the floor, leaving not a trace. She turned around and around in the air, whipping the fountain of sparks like ribbons, and showered Iris with it.</p>
<p>"How did you do it?" Iris asked, dodging into bed, watching. The mattress was soft. It felt like lying on feathers.</p>
<p>"Magic." Lindsay climbed in, too. "<em>Holy</em>! The Council people will be so jealous---they form the entity that oversees the five schools. Past grandmasters. We answer to them. But yeah, magic. Elves don't like that word, though. They prefer 'arts'."</p>
<p>"Why isn't Sally like you?"</p>
<p>"You mean why Billy and I can use elven arts without accessories? Heh." She pulled Iris closer. Iris gasped in surprise. "Bed story time!</p>
<p>"One word: Transcriptor. The machine in the Institute is an information processor. It copies information from one medium to another. By information I don't mean just words... It's everything---every description of matter. If we, say, transfer the information of a book to a blank notebook, the result would be two identical-looking books, down to the dog ear on a specific page. With the machine being the only surviving one we know of, naturally Billy and I were interested when we visited the Institute years ago.</p>
<p>"It was old... a relic of tens and thousands of years, built before the elves left for Valinor. It was maintained but still had rare malfunctions, and being the impulsive kid he was, Billy disregarded all warnings. It happened when he tried to transcribe an elven dictionary into his mind. Know what he said before going in?"</p>
<p>"Uh...?"</p>
<p>"'Dictionaries can't hurt, can it?'" Lindsay scoffed. "There were enough elven DNA tucked within the pages for the machine to compare and overwrite in his body, enough to make him elf-like. I tried to pull him out and I got caught in the blast, as well.</p>
<p>"We <em>are</em> still human...but we're not mere humans anymore."</p>
<p>"Was it painful?"</p>
<p>"We've had worse. There are more painful things than physical harm---um... I mean..."</p>
<p>"Memories, huh..."</p>
<p>"Iris..." Lindsay stopped and brought their foreheads together. It was a while before she spoke again. "There's a reason we didn't just wipe your memory all these days."</p>
<p>"A reason? A cruel one, I suppose..."</p>
<p>"It would be cruel to make you forget." Lindsay emphasized every word. "Listen---"</p>
<p>"But <em>I</em> don't want to remember---"</p>
<p>"You're no coward." Lindsay's arms were tight around her.</p>
<p>"It hurts to remember, to know those memories will only be memories now---"</p>
<p>"It'll pass. I promise. The pain will pass." Lindsay murmured. "Iris, please. Cherish the memories and eyes forward. That's how we all got through in the Academy. Most of us there are humans, and even the youngest apprentice had to live through it if their parents---Telepathic intervention was always forbidden on trauma, because it only makes it worse. Do you really want to forget Madam Yu and Camilla? And all the others? Does forgetting do them any justice?" Iris didn't reply. She wondered when Lindsay would ask her if forgetting them was what Madam Yu and Camilla wanted next. If it took away her pain, they would want that. Iris would want Rubik to forget if she had died---she wished he would forget his grandmother if it meant he would live a happier life. Lindsay pressed on, firm, "The remorse for forgetting is more painful than reliving the memories. Transcriptor won't help. Telepathy won't help. And if anyone---if anything happens to anyone tomorrow, it'd be on me, and I can't just---just wipe that away from myself, either."</p>
<p><em>What do you know.</em> Iris thought. She felt Lindsay's heart pick up pace against her own.</p>
<p>"E-enough of that. I shouldn't have brought it up. I'm sorry..."</p>
<center>
**
</center>
<p>The chilly morning, the dreary sky, and the prospect of departure sent waves of anxiety through Iris. The possibility of seeing at least Fay again, however, brought her hope and excitement.</p>
<p>"A ship bigger than our orphanage. We'll finally get to see it." Rubik tidied his cloak. Iris nodded. The elven-made cloaks, Rowana had said, were to hide the wearers from unwanted eyes, as long as they didn't draw attention to themselves. The plan was for Rubik and Iris to stay out of sight the entire time. Billy and Lindsay would pass the check gates in their stead.</p>
<p>"Ready?" Billy came out to the living room, also in a cloak. He was to hide while Rubik and Iris boarded, and to reveal himself until the ship departed. He walked up to Rubik and smirked. Rubik smirked back. Iris had trouble telling who was whom for one second. "Not bad, the cloak fits. Now get that hairband on. Colaurë will be monitoring our minds if not anything."</p>
<p>The eight of them in their gray cloaks marched down and out of the hotel.</p>
<p>"Aren't you checking out?" Rubik asked.</p>
<p>"Booked it for a week." Billy grunted.</p>
<p>"What?!"</p>
<p>"Why not? It's free." Sparcal gave him a rare toothy grin.</p>
<p>Elowen launched the car. They followed Rowana's jeep down the road and out onto the wide street. Iris slid down in her seat, trying to quiet her heart and stomach. She watched the gray city that slid past her wake up. Vendors revved their motorized tricycles to pull the stalls and carts into position, and unlatched the windows. Storekeepers rolled up the metal sheets of blinds in front of their doors. A few old men unwound the strings from the reels and unfurled their kites on a square, where a giant red sculpture stood bright against the clouds. That was the May Fire, Iris recalled from her history classes. On the May 24th two hundred years ago, a patriot mole within the colonial government set fire to the Union Jack atop the Colonial Parliament Hall in this city, and unveiled the Liberation War. The sculpture also served as an lighthouse. Iris wished they could see it in Kumamoto. Lindsay stared out of her window, elbow on the door handle and biting her nails.</p>
<p>"Lindsay? Do you think we'll see Fay?"</p>
<p>"Mm-hmm."</p>
<p>"I hope she and Luting stayed at a good place these days..."</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>"...Are you still mad at her?"</p>
<p>"Mmm?" Lindsay jerked around. "What? You mean that day? The ward I placed on the head chef's door alerts me when breached and I had a day's worth of headaches thanks to Rubik kicking at it. I've nothing against Fay."</p>
<p>"Oh." Iris' lips twitched. "Sorry."</p>
<p>The commercial district shrank down with every meter they advanced. Iris half-curled in her seat, eyes unfocused, trying to stop her own mind from reading out every sign that glided past. The glamours and clamours of this bustling city were safe from war. It should stay that way. Not all people here looked happy, but at least they weren't miserable, like the rest of the country was. Born near the sea, steeped in a sea of colonial history, indulged in a sea of prosperity, they knew nothing of the atrocities of war; they had no fear of their lives coming to an abrupt halt; they might never lose all they had in a second---well, a great portion of them, at least. It was unreal how this city was spared in the war that might finally end soon, and many of them would almost never know it had ever happened. Iris felt jealous. They would never dread the stopping of a jeep.</p>
<p>She didn't know why she did. She just wished Elowen would keep driving, on and on and never stop. Even the slightest change in speed was a crack of anxiety in the reality, and as the last steel disappeared from the passing buildings, the anxiety intensified and suffocated her. Perhaps it was the unknown future. She didn't like changes, and here she was, rushing towards it, allowing herself to be carried to it. Her days with the Ereldar was short but hard to describe in a single word or phrase. An amalgam of feelings. A modicum taste of a life that offered much more. Iris felt like she had stayed with them for much longer than a week---yet they were still pretty much strangers. At least she was comforted to know that there existed a group of strangers among whom and a place where she could feel safe. Like this jeep, unchanging in its moving state.</p>
<p>They parked by the road.</p>
<p>"This is goodbye for us." Elowen and Nix said. They were to exert mass-telepathy to the area, since elves from the Temple focused on mental prowess training. They needed to suppress any thoughts of calling the police, and to evacuate the port if conflicts arise. "Take care, Iris." They hugged her. "Best of luck overseas." Iris nodded and watched them share one last joke with Rubik, their teeth radiant against their dark lips. Then, they simply faded away, under the influence of the cloaks.</p>
<p>"Boy, I'm coming back when things settle." Rowana strode over and kissed Iris. "I'll find you in Kumamoto, yeah?"</p>
<p>"We're so close to finishing them off. I can't wait for a boring, uneventful life with nothing but research and archaeology." Lindsay muttered. "So I'll be tagging along, too, Rowana."</p>
<p>"Until then, farewell." Sparcal shook hands with Iris. "You and Rubik stay alert. Do not relax until you lose sight of the harbor. Take care." With a nod, he and Rowana vanished, too, to scout and secure the area.</p>
<p>The four of them crossed the road and entered Port Minor. A crowd moved alongside them, some dressed in suits and coats and looking at people through their nostrils, some shabby-clothed and covered in dirt and shrinking from the rest. How much did they save up for a ticket? How many days did they walk to get here? Where were they going? Iris didn't know. She looked around, half-hopeful to see anyone she might recognize. No one.</p>
<p>The security and the ticket checkpoints were ahead. Through the metal fence on their left, Iris saw ships far out by the piers---they were huge, alright: the bow of the ships towered high over the scene, blocking out the sky; their superstructures were two thirds of the ships' length, and three or four rows of windows ran from their heads to tails; above that were two to three thick chimneys exhausting white steam. Iris didn't know how long or how tall these liners were, but yes---Rubik glanced at her with glee---they were bigger than their orphanage.</p>
<p>They didn't look cheap at all. Eight tickets, all first-class no less---just how rich had Madam Yu been?</p>
<p>They stopped for a quick bathroom break. The girls joined the line at the ladies. By the piers, Iris saw soldiers in white. She tugged Lindsay and pointed. Lindsay nodded, her eyes glowing.</p>
<p>"Marines, huh. Their caps were planted, alright. Don't draw attention. Stay calm."</p>
<p>"Rowana found a small squad by pier 8. She's staying put until Colaurë shows up." Billy came back, muttering. "It's boarding time. I'm heading in with Rubik. You two take your time." He kissed Lindsay good luck and gave Iris a nod. They disappeared into the crowd. Iris and Lindsay made it quick, and merged into the security lines. They had only one trunk, and thanks to the cloak, Iris went through the security undetected. The officer opened the trunk with only Iris' bag of medications, and closed it with a satisfied nod. Lindsay tapped her temple at Iris with a knowing eye.</p>
<p>"Elowen and Nix, not me. Ticket and customs ahead; same deal. Stay close."</p>
<p>It was slow even in their first-class express lane. <em>Why can't we just charge through in our cloaks?</em> Iris' answer came as they rounded a turn, and she saw the customs officers stamp the documents. <em>Oh... they'll be checking for that on the other side, I guess. But then can't I charge through there, too?</em> Then she remembered Rowana, and pulled a face at herself, feeling rather ashamed to be as amoral as her in less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>They were next. She grabbed Lindsay's hand and approached. The wizened old officer checked the ticket against the documents and his own records. Iris looked around, trembling. Again, no sign of anyone she knew---! For a split second she thought she had saw Anne, but when she did a double-take, no more signs of her.</p>
<p>"You dyed your hair, I see." The old man beamed dotingly at Lindsay through his thick glasses.</p>
<p>"Mum did it for me. Isn't it pretty?" Lindsay wrapped a fistful of hair around her face, batting her lashes.</p>
<p>"Indeed they are." The officer lifted his cap. "Bon voyage, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"Don't make me do that again." Lindsay grimaced once out of earshot.</p>
<p>"But the impeccable accent!" Iris breathed.</p>
<p>"Had a good role model." Lindsay hugged her. "This should be it. Stay safe. I can sense Colaurë already...like a whisper from pier 8. Come. You board at 7." They walked, reluctant. Around them, people hurried on with their trunks, looking eager or wistful. A dog barked at the seagulls. The sea was quiet. In the near distance, cranes from Port Major loaded and unloaded cargo containers. Billy was nowhere in sight. It meant Rubik was already aboard.</p>
<p>The sun came out as they reached the empty pier 6. The ship at pier 7 was even bigger than those earlier ones. She craned her neck at the triple chimneys, and tried her best to count the number of the rows of windows. The fences on the deck were so small in comparison to the bow, and she could hardly see the stern of the ship. Three separate anchor chains rooted the behemoth in place. Waves lowered to reveal barnacles plastered to the bow. The shiny letters on the starboard spelt out "TS <em>Leviathan</em>". This was a liner for the Americas, after all; Kumamoto was only its first stop. <em>How many people are going to be on this?</em> Iris was so awestruck that she didn't even mind the sour smell of burning tar from the chimneys.</p>
<p>"Great Mother God... If mum or Cam could see this..."</p>
<p>Lindsay lashed out her arm in a sudden, blocking Iris' way.</p>
<p>"No...no, what's he doing?"</p>
<p>Iris followed her alarmed gaze to the deck. The first thing she saw was Fay, hair loose but overall tidy enough; then she saw Luting, her companion for her errand a week ago, standing before Fay against a gang of tough-looking men; finally she saw Rubik in his cloak, running at them. Except that Iris knew she shouldn't be able to see him at all. <em>He was not willingly concealing himself.</em></p>
<p>"Fuck that idiot---" Lindsay was about to take off when the troop at pier 8 caught her eyes. Out of their ranks strode a tall man in quick paces, his golden hair gleamed and swayed in the sun, a long-barreled gun in hand, raising to aim. The troop behind him didn't follow, but turned to the commotion starting at its back.</p>
<p>"COLAURË!" Billy charged out of nowhere, his cloak ripped off in a fury and fluttered to the ground. "I'M HERE!"</p>
<p>The passengers on the deck leaned over the fence to look. The travelers on the pier and the harbor, however, all ran for cover. Iris saw Rowana's golden hair flying among the troops at pier 8 while at the other end of the port, Sparcal rammed into the squad at pier 3. Colaurë looked from Billy to Rubik to Billy.</p>
<p>"I'M HERE, ASSHOLE!" Rubik bellowed from the deck. Lindsay growled and unsheathed her sword, poised to throw. Billy wasted no time to pounce on the elf. A warship sailed into Iris' field of vision, its turrets turning toward the harbor.</p>
<p>"No---" She grabbed Lindsay.</p>
<p>In a fluid motion Colaurë blocked Billy's crushing blade with his gun and wound it out of the way, firing a bullet at the end of his swing. The bullet hit the portside hull below Rubik. Smoke puffed out of the warship's turrets. Iris watched the rounds fly and hit an invisible wall halfway. More came and fell. Lindsay, arms stretched, was blocking them.</p>
<p>The duel in the middle of the harbor was in full rage. Billy hammered blow after blow at the elf, who parried and dodged, shooting at Rubik and slicing at his attacker with a dagger in the other hand.</p>
<p><em>Leviathan</em>'s sailors scrambled to lift the gangplank. The beast of a ship roar to life. Anchors were raised, expelling torrents from its chain holes. Slowly its steam turbine turned and inched the hulk of its body out of the harbor. The warship stopped firing. Iris's sigh of relief was choked back by a low boom and a whistle. The stern of the ship exploded. Two blasts sent a wave crashing into the harbor. Lindsay covered for Iris with her sword. The obscuring water gave way to the sight of the mortar shells, now unhindered, crashing into the superstructure, the chimney, and the foredeck.</p>
<p>Iris saw the explosions but never felt their shock waves or heard the blasts. She saw the ship and its passengers shredded into pieces but never heard their screams. She saw the wooden planked piers catch and burst into flames, and the burning pieces from that and the ship fly and smash against the ground all around her, but she didn't feel their heat. Lindsay's barrier protected her from all physical harm, but not psychological trauma. Behind Lindsay's back she fell to her knees as the silent explosion raged on, her cast and hand over her mouth, her eyes wide with horror, her breath strangled in her chest.</p>
<p>What was there left to utter? Useless whimpers of disbelief? Helpless squeals of their names? The clangs from the duel sounded sharp and jarring, each metallic blow pierced her eardrums and skewered through her brain. What had they ever done to deserve this---what had anyone? The world was unfair, crooked, twisted, and cruel. It was never their fault. It was all <em>their</em> fault. Great Mother God, how she hated it. How she hated Colaurë---How she hated everyone involved.</p>
<p>So Iris, her mind in pieces, collapsed and screamed.</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>“These barcodes are elven." Billy gaped as he scrolled through the sequence taken from Rubik. He switched to Iris', and saw the same thing.</p>
<p>"Not just that. I checked a few other genes, too." Sally pointed.</p>
<p>"Out of 28, 25 elven versions and two human versions. The last one is completely novel." Lindsay tilted her head. "Huh... the humans here aren't human, and this world is supposed to resemble ours the most?"</p>
<p>"Checks and balances of underlying physics produce a similarity overall, I would wager." Elowen said.</p>
<p>"But what does that mean for our elves?" Kijuu, the grandmaster of the Archive, massaged his beard. "Will their powers fade away? Obviously I assume you two kids will be fine." He nodded at Billy and Lindsay. "You are half-blooded, right?"</p>
<p>"Heterozygous for elven genes, yes." Sally replied. "We've been here for two months and the medical team haven't noticed any degradation of elven abilities in anyone, yet."</p>
<p>"So as long as we're fast, we should be alright." Raja, the grandmaster of the University, nodded.</p>
<p>"Perhaps. It's the first time we encountered this."</p>
<p>"Do they go on journeys when they die prematurely, though?" Kijuu leaned forward.</p>
<p>"The Journey" was what happened to the mind of the elf who died of unnatural causes, such as murder or suicide. Billy remembered how he had woken up knowing nothing, floating down a stream, and had wandered the surrounding forest until he arrived in a vale, where Nirvanya, an elf elderess, restored his memories and returned him back to his body. The principle of the Journey was unknown. Nirvanya refused to disclose anything other than to what the Journey pertained. The only thing they were certain was that the Vale wasn't the Blessed Realm of Valinor, and that the process worked regardless of worlds.</p>
<p>"You mean that might be how the two armies get unlimited soldiers?" Lindsay raised an eyebrow. "I'm not going to find out, man."</p>
<p>"No, we can just drag one of those bodies from the piles---"</p>
<p>"How's this genetic finding going to change our mission here?" Raja rolled her eyes and cut across Kijuu. "Supposing we didn't catch Colaurë before elves suffer degradation?"</p>
<p>"<em>Pfft</em>." Rowana, her feet on the table and hands behind her head, rocked on the hind legs of her chair and giggled. Sparcal grinned, too. She stared at the ceiling with a dreamy smirk, caring about nobody's raised eyebrows or questioning gaze. "Imagine how pissed Colaurë is right now."</p>
<center>
**
</center>
<p>Rowana lifted Colaurë through the air. Colaurë struggled and broke free with difficulty. Billy's thrown blade missed him by a second. He landed right before Billy and slashed down with his dagger. To his surprise, it was blocked by his sword that appeared out of nowhere. They attacked and parried, dodged and sidestepped, Rowana joined the fray and the three of them weaved in and out of the flaming debris and the burning ground. Colaurë soon found himself about to be overwhelmed. He managed to backflip behind a towering piece of the ship's hull, overdriving his revolver with his elven art and spraying down the harbor to keep them at bay. He needed to escape, fast.</p>
<p>Billy twirled his wide sword and parried the barrage back, embedding the bullets in the hull. Rowana nocked an arrow.</p>
<p>"Old damn soot has quite some power left." She nodded to herself and released the bowstring. The arrow shot past an opening in Billy's sword swings and pierced through the metal hunk. The barrage went on.</p>
<p>"Oh my, did you miss?" Billy teased.</p>
<p>"I just made your job easier, dammit." Rowana nocked another arrow. The hunk of metal Colaurë hid behind exploded. Something dinged against Billy's sword. It was half of a revolver's cylinder. Rowana nudged it with her toe. "That, plus a breather."</p>
<p>Lindsay broke out of the black smoke, flipping through the air, bombarding Colaurë inside with fire. She landed and skidded to a halt before them.</p>
<p>"The marines gave you no problem? Get to Iris. I can't help her." She ripped open a rift with her sword. Rowana went in without ado. Lindsay looked at Billy, "Are we still capturing him?" He nodded. "Sure."</p>
<center>
**
</center>
<p><em>Poor thing.</em> Rowana thought, thrusting her hands between Iris' hands and her scalp to stop her from clawing it. Iris' mouth foamed from her screams and her body shivered violently. Rowana threw off Iris' hairband and clasped her tight in her arms. She touched their forehead together.</p>
<p>Iris' mind was a swirl of oversaturated emotions and pieces of intense memories soaked in psychedelic colors. It was a large stained-glass window, shattered and ground into fine powders, and they were trickling away through a hole.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." Rowana whispered. She invaded Iris' mind to its deepest core, and asserted control. Iris' scream subsided and her body went limp. Rowana sent a thought pattern throughout Iris' mind, a pattern that was used as a telepathy exercise in the Ereldar curriculum. If Iris indeed had an elven-like genome, then this pattern should resonate with her mind enough to not just calm it down but also patch itself, to an extent that would at least recover the bits that had trickled away.</p>
<p>Iris' body responded by digging her nails into Rowana's back.</p>
<center>
**
</center>
<p>Soldiers disembarked their rafts and opened fire. Billy concentrated his attacks on Colaurë while Lindsay dealt with the advancing squad. The usual dis-helmet tactics lost its efficiency half a minute in, when more and more soldiers breached the burning debris in the sea from the warship beyond. Lindsay wondered if this warranted breaking the Ereldar rule of killing innocents---these people were under Colaurë's influence, true, but her life, and Billy's, were at stake. <em>Or I can just disable them some other way.</em></p>
<p>She swiped her sword before her and let go. The sword, tip down and upright, spun around her in a blur, forming a barrier. Lindsay gathered her senses and let it seep through every soldier around pier 7, regardless of where they were. She tried to get hold of their chips, but couldn't; then she tried their helmets, and that failed, too. So Lindsay sighed and mustered all the power she could. She levitated every soldier into the air, and hanged them in place.</p>
<p>Colaurë's presence rushed in, knocking the fallen rifles aside. Lindsay grabbed her spinning sword just in time to parry his furious daggers. She kicked him in the chest. He fell back, right into Billy's headlock.</p>
<p>"Just the break I needed." From Colaurë's hair Billy dug out a hairband. "Twenty years of this place drained your telepathy, I see." He crumbled the hairband in front of the elf's eyes. The soldiers overhead stopped fighting against their restrains. Lindsay let them fall. Now under Elowen and Nix's influence, they fled. She hanged Colaurë instead.</p>
<p>"Go ahead." Containing Colaurë with effort, she grunted to Billy, who leapt up, sword poised. Killing the elf now would send him on Journey. When he finished it, he'd wake up imprisoned, back in their own world and ready for interrogation.</p>
<p>The air around Colaurë rippled. Halfway upwards Billy felt himself being drawn in. He clicked his tongue in annoyance.</p>
<p>The elf broke free in an explosion. The shock wave blasted a crater in the cement below and rekindled the dying fires around pier 7. Lindsay flew through two of these fires and crashed into a stray part of <em>Leviathan</em>. Billy plunged into the sea.</p>
<center>
**
</center>
<p>He wondered how many people's blood were on his hands, in both literal and figurative senses, as he fell through the nightmarish underwater. Clouds of blood dissipated and recoalesced. Flesh and debris submerged and re-emerged. He saw the stern of <em>Leviathan</em> at the bottom: two holes marked where the torpedoes had made contact.</p>
<p>The liner, as an advertisement that was now ashes had said, carried around 4000 people, including the crew. The orphanage, according to Iris, had 60 or so residents, 41 of them underaged children. The two days of bombing had destroyed an area where at least 100 people hid or lived and counted on their luck to see the next day.</p>
<p>All gone, because of one person who shared his face, whose blood now soaked his entirety. Would Rubik have died without the hairband? Billy watched a lacerated arm float past. His concern for manipulation from Colaurë was unfounded and disproven. The elf relied on the chips for telepathy, now, and he could only manipulate those with chips, too. Perhaps he could still read minds with his chip; then he'd know Rubik wasn't his target, and wouldn't have ordered to attack the ship...</p>
<p>Billy turned his body and kicked upwards. Let there be one more person's blood on his hands to avenge the 4200 others. Colaurë would see Valinor today.</p>
<center>
**
</center>
<p>Lindsay picked herself up, patching her wounds with quick, crude stitches by magic. She hissed from the pain. It felt like there were two long ones on her back, one on her right arm, and one across her left thigh. At least her weapon arm, her left, was intact. This was it. Colaurë couldn't be captured that easily. Might as well eliminate him instead. It seemed that his telepathy had succumbed to this world's law first. Pity that he retained his other elven powers.</p>
<p>The only way to truly kill him was to damage his body beyond repair. <em>Not the first time I have to do this.</em> Lindsay steeled herself and blasted the pile of ship parts before her aside.</p>
<p>Colaurë was just coming around, as well. Was he staggering from the effort of using an elven art of that degree? That would mean his elven powers were crippled somewhat, too. Lindsay snarled and charged in. Colaurë blocked with his daggers.</p>
<p>"Is this the best you humans can do? Your little boyfriend did not even hit me." He sneered.</p>
<p>"Then I will." Lindsay hissed. Three strikes were blocked and Lindsay kicked off, skating around the elf, engaging and disengaging him like a boomerang. She focused on his arms, cutting the same place until her flurry drew blood and exposed the bones. The elf seemed to have spent his power. He could no longer use his arts---he was certainly slower, without the enhanced speed or agility anymore.</p>
<p>What he lacked in magic, he made up with five centuries of experience. On her next pass, Lindsay was wound around to Colaurë's other side. She felt his daggers dig into the two wounds on her back. The searing pain toppled her down into a heap. Colaurë closed in for the final blow.</p>
<p>In a splash of water Billy broke the surface and and bowled Colaurë over. He rolled onto his feet and back in he went. Colaurë's face mirrored his own hatred. Blow by blow they exchanged, venting their disdain and scorn and rage into every strike that were no longer measured. In a wild roundhouse slash Colaurë sent Billy backwards, spraying the ground with blood. With a strained roar the boy rebounded back, left eye bloody and shut, and showed the elf just what a human's wrath could mean.</p>
<p>In less than ten seconds Colaurë lost his left arm that was already flayed to the bone. In the next thirty-two seconds he realized that the girl was carving up his back in revenge. One minute later, after adding more wounds to both of their faces and bodies, and another deep gash in the boy's right eye, Colaurë noticed that both of them had a huge metallic claw each on their off-hand arm, sprung out of their bracers, but wasn't sure when this had happened. Two minutes mark, Colaurë found arrows sticking from his body. He saw daggers and lances, felt hammers and bullets, endured fire and lightning, and realized that they were using every weapon they have at their disposal. He wasn't sure how he was still standing. He couldn't control his arm. He couldn't feel any pain or any heat from the fires nearby anymore, not even that from his own hatred, nor the slimy coldness from his shame. To be killed by humans not having even reached their adulthood was the worst mockery he knew---he had considered his colleagues died at the Ereldar's hands weak, and now...But that was because of this world, surely... Had they met him at his full power...</p>
<p>But the girl fought as if she was never wounded, and the boy as though he was never blinded. Colaurë mustered all the strength he had left and gambled the last bit of his art into one final strike.</p>
<p>A bronze cube was flicked into the air by Billy and clicked apart. The device, built from the same technology derived from the Transcriptor, began siphoning 500 years' worth of memories from Colaurë into its glowing blue core.</p>
<p>"You aren't even close to the worst we've killed." Lindsay whispered, eyes hard. She parried and flung his dagger out of his hand. She was sure she ripped open more wounds on her body, but she held on the momentum and thrust forward her off-hand.</p>
<p>The elf spun, arm thrown wide aside. The last thing he felt was the pain from two claws that pierced through his body, front and back. The device clicked back into a cube and hit the ground. The two of them sheathed their claws and collapsed with Colaurë's body.</p>
<p>Pier 7 was as scarred as any of them. Bodies---what was left of them---and scraps of the ship and the pier scattered about the blood-splattered, crater-filled, cracked and blackened ground.</p>
<p>They dragged themselves around the elf, and leaned upon the other.</p>
<p>"Your eyes---"</p>
<p>"Nothing that can't be fixed." He kept his head down and away from her reaching hand. "You stop moving. Don't bleed out."</p>
<p>"Nothing that can't be fixed." She sighed. They sat, panting.</p>
<p>"Lindsay?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sweet?"</p>
<p>"Is this even a success?" He gasped as a surge of pain shot through his eyes. She felt it in her mind. "Why do I feel like I'm the evil one?"</p>
<p>"I feel just as guilty." She murmured and kissed him. Sparcal was with Rowana, bowing over Iris. Elowen and Nix were flying over from afar. Otherwise, Port Minor was as deserted as it could be in the cackling fires.</p>
<center>
**

<p>"Iris---" Rowana had lost all her airiness. Iris ignored her. She wished she had never woken up, so she didn't have to fall back into that horrid whirlpool of chaos every night, to revisit the orphanage, Madam Yu, Camilla, Mr. Gao, Anne, Fay, Timmy and Tina---everyone, just to watch their ends again, and to scream herself awake in tears and sweat. She wished she had never woken up, so when daylight disintegrated the nightmares, she didn't have to reason with herself whether to blame or to hate the Ereldar---especially <em>him</em>. It wasn't any of their fault, but stripped down to its core... it was.</p>
<p>"Iris... please eat." Rowana's voice was breaking. "I didn't want to control you again. Can you just eat?"</p>
<p>She and Sparcal had been forcing food down Iris' throat through telepathy, just to keep her alive, and to live through all the turmoil again. Should Iris hate them for doing what everyone deemed the right thing against her will and judgment?</p>
<p>Elowen and Nix came in daily to check on her mental state. They didn't wipe her memories. They probed her mind, sieving and organizing her thoughts, and tried to get her talk. They said talking would help heal the mental wounds. Should Iris hate them for not wiping her most painful memories and lying in her face?</p>
<p>The only two who were missing...Iris didn't care. They were the ones responsible the most. She hated them for their absence.</p>
<p>Since she had woken up in the hotel room, on one side of the merged bed, she hadn't spoken a word, or moved of her own will at all. Rowana ushered her to toilets and showers and walks on the beach like a puppet. She didn't know how long she had lain there unconscious, and she had stopped counting the days passed. She laid in her side of the bed like a patient in a vegetative state, watching through the skylight overhead the weather outside move from the March breeze to the April showers. She kept hearing the news from the living room talking about the ongoing investigations in Port Minor (Rowana had told her what had happened but all she cared was...nothing). The cries of seagulls had increased. Her cast had started to crack.</p>
<p>What would happen next? All she knew was that she had nothing left in this world, and she clung to the knowledge, the only concrete thing she had. Her nightmares reinforced it, and for once, she embraced them, like a wandering cloud embracing the fact that ultimately it would fall and die as raindrops.</p>
<p>When a day in late April, she opened her eyes, she felt something soft on her side. It was her left arm and hand. The cast had fallen apart. She flexed her fingers and pressed her forearm. She lifted her sheet to pick at the white plaster bits. The arm smelled. Iris leapt out of her bed and stumbled into the bathroom, walking on her own in weeks, and collapsed onto the toilet in an attack of vertigo, an eruption of black spots and straying stars before her eyes. Crying as she stripped, she climbed into the bathtub, and let water bombarded her body. It was so good to have her own body back.</p>
<p>Rowana knocked and entered. She waited until Iris had finished the longest shower she had ever taken---Iris had scrubbed her arm red, feeling it might never smell clean again. Rowana stared at her when she pulled back the curtain, struggling with herself. Iris hadn't heard her knock, but she didn't care anymore. Rowana was the one who washed her every day. Did elves ever become speechless, especially this one, who flirted with everybody? Iris' time with them had subverted a lot of her beliefs.</p>
<p>"Nice figure." Rowana seemed to have decided to revert back to her frivolous self the best she could. Iris ripped the curtains back shut. She heard Rowana stomp her feet two full seconds later: "At least get dressed before getting mad at me!"</p>
<p><em>How feeble a retort.</em> Iris thought.</p>
<p>Lindsay sat waiting with Billy when Iris returned to the room. She leaned on a staff and he wore a blindfold. She tried to stand up. He stopped her and stood up himself. Rowana settled Iris down by the bed and joined them.</p>
<p>"Our titles mean little," he started, voice cold and hard like the first time Iris had met him in that alleyway millennia ago, "but we still hold one of the leadership positions at our respective schools." Iris scoffed at the carpeted floor. What was he doing, reasserting his authority? To give her orders to eat, to speak, to not have survivor's guilt? It was all his fault (<em>Even if it wasn't his fault they look alike, it still is.</em> She thought). He swallowed and went on, "Elowen is out getting groceries with Nix and the other two grandmasters don't arrive until tomorrow, but I---I cannot wait anymore."</p>
<p>To Iris' surprise, out of the corner of her eyes she saw him sink into a deep bow. Rowana followed suit.</p>
<p>"W-we have brought you pain and trauma beyond all reckoning. We f-failed our promise. Please---please allow us two to apologize for all we have caused, in place for the Council of Ereldar and the other grandmasters of our s-schools." He steadied his breath. "If you have any anger and hatred, please, vent them on me. I'm personally responsible---"</p>
<p>"Apologies can't bring back anyone... Iris, if you want anything, please, just ask. We will do anything, though I know it will never be enough..."</p>
<p>Would they really do it if she asked them to snuff her miserable life? Iris clenched her teeth and dug her nails into her lap. She felt cold. She felt sick. She had enough. Just kill her. There'd be nobody to miss her. Make her leave this stupid world where the kind were always punished and the evil were always rewarded. If she wanted anything? Plunge those elaborate pair of swords into her, then. She was washed clean. She'd die as she had come.</p>
<p>Lindsay tugged at the two still bowing and sat them down. This somehow made Iris breathe easier. The mattress sacked beside her and Lindsay's arms, shaking with pain, wrapped around her.</p>
<p>"You don't have to die to leave, Iris." Iris turned her head away from her. Lindsay held her tighter. "Please. I don't want you to die."</p>
<p>Iris felt her shoulder got wet.</p>

<p>The door banged open and in charged Sally. She fell onto Iris.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling? Are you alright? Nightmares? Dizziness? How's your arm? The cast's off. Does it hurt, still? It's rare but just to make sure---"</p>
<p>Even if Sally and Camilla had been counterparts, which they weren't, she still couldn't replace her. Iris let her fret on, and looked away, expressionless. She hadn't spoken for so long. Her throat felt dead. Sally held her face.</p>
<p>"We placed charms around their graves so when---if you ever come back, you can visit, okay?" Iris closed her eyes. She had convinced herself not to ask for their ashes. She couldn't bear to have that evidence of everything: her lost life, their death, this sickening world. Rubik didn't even have anything to bury.</p>
<p>Might as well.</p>
<p>"The head chef---I'm sorry, Iris---I'm so sorry---we had to send him to Japan. Iris! Listen---somebody had to tell Madam Yu's friend about what happened, Iris---oh I'm so sorry... We planted a cue in his mind---once he arrives in Kumamoto, it'll force him to find the lady and deliver the news. But listen! Billy and Lindsay planted it, so you'll never know what else they put in there! They could be cruel to the right, or wrong, people." Iris wondered what good Sally was doing by telling her this. She didn't want to know more things to complicate her feelings toward those two. If that "something else" was to kill himself, then Iris didn't know if it was punishment or mercy; if it was to have him live a cruel life, Iris didn't know how to feel about herself being the incentive for someone else's misery. <em>Would Sally label my experiences as "cruel"?</em></p>
<p>Sally let go of her and drew out something from her bag. Iris' head whipped around. How could this be---the bunny---it should've burnt up with the orphanage---but here it was, the same one Camilla had given her on her first birthday at that place. Iris grabbed it and turned it over and over in her hands. Not exactly the same. One of its ears was missing and part of its limbs had much smaller stitches. Sally fiddled with her glasses.</p>
<p>"Well, um---he-he said not to tell, but he went back to the ruins and found this. He asked us medics to 'do our thing', and, you know, we're good at stitching." Sally let out a small smile. Iris' expression softened. Sally sounded much more relaxed as she went on. "Elves were good at fixing things, and I helped where I could. There are places just irreparable here so we left it at that. For now. But I promise! The Academy got the best tailors in all schools! We'll get them to help the first thing we get back---um..."</p>
<p><em>It's the only thing I have left now.</em> Iris buried her face in the bunny, curling up. <em>A good one.</em></p>
<p>"You are coming with us, right?" Sally sounded almost afraid of the answer.</p>
<p>"Yes." Iris whispered, hoarse, to the bunny. "You come with me."</p>
