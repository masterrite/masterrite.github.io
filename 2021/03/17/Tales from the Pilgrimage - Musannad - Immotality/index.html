        <p>With a cry from an eagle, he came at the tail of winter. I shifted silently on my back, listening…</p>
<p>A cold, rigid gale descended from the peaks that cradled our town Musannad. The stranger followed it, past the abandoned crop fields, towards the battered trading post at the edge of the town. Snowflakes mingled with dirt chipped away its already eroded floral patterns on the stuccos, grinding the intricate down to simplistic. The wind pushed the stranger through what was left of the door curtains that draped down the entrance. It rampaged, kicked dust over the debris of the collapsed inner walls, tugged at the moth-eaten textiles, and slammed into the stubborn statues of voluptuous maids that refused to fall from their archways, over the tessellation of lions hunting deer under a tree.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>If the wind was acting as an aloof guide for the stranger, then he didn’t seem to be impressed by its displays. He inched through the interior, taking in all of its faded but not yet diminished beauty. Ages ago, when the trading post he just walked out of still functioned like a <em>musannad</em>—“support”—a cushion, hot bath, filling food, warm bed, and smiling faces from both our townspeople and other travelers were a must for visitors like him. He descended towards the town: a mass outcropping of yellow sandstones and clay throughout, with a tumbled-down mosque at the north end, the foot of the peaks.</p>
<p>I lay next to Raja, both of us immobile like the rest of the town. We no longer care for strangers, or eating, drinking, making love, even moving. We had shut our eyes and most of our other senses long ago. Hearing was the only thing we could not turn off: our thoughts could not drown the sounds of nature. We listened involuntarily of the passing world, ears sharper with every passing decade. We heard the wind weave its course around the stranger’s thin and somewhat short frame, and some metal clinked and clanged with every step. We heard grains of sunlight bouncing off his black hair, an elusive tinge of red blended within. He turned his head in every direction as he trod the only path into Musannad, and traced even the tiniest crack in the wall with interest. We heard the flutters of wings, powerful ones, and the eagle that had shrieked landed on his right shoulder. He turned his long, thin face to greet it, and the capricious wind became envious. It screamed for attention that the town had denied it for centuries, but the stranger merely responded by reaching back and pulling on his—</p>
<p>“Nadim…” Raja called me, a hoarse rasp after centuries of silence. My eyes opened and rolled into her wide, brown ones brimming with fear. She looked still 22, the same every year, but her eyes bore holes drilled by thousands of years. “Nadim… he wore a <em>hood</em>.”</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>The stranger continued his exploration down Musannad’s street, where children raced eons ago, and moved towards the mosque. Our mosque, in these high mountains, was said to be the closest to heaven after Mecca’s. Our forefathers raised granite pillars for the hypostyle hall that could house a thousand people, and erected the qibla wall at the southwest. Hang before the unusually deep mihrab that could fit a fully-grown person inside was an additional prayer rug. The carved pedals on the pillars were plated with gold. Rare blue porcelain tiled the wall. Many an artisan contributed their skills to the intricate silver tree embedded in the mihrab. Such was the mosque we built in gratitude of Allah for this fertile land, tucked away among the titanic peaks. But as time trampled on, the pillars crashed down like dominoes, the qibla wall crumbled into a heap; the prayer rug joined the dust, and the mihrab hidden instead by rubble and debris; tarnish was the ultimate fate of gold and silver. Only the minaret at the remnant of the mosque entrance survived. The stranger circled it slowly, lips forming the Kufic scripts around and around the wall, the richest gold against the background of the most refreshing blue. He climbed up the footholds in the wall, like the Muezzin did long ago. The small marble tower standing among the mosque ruins looked, at a distance, much like a rude middle finger towards the town and Mecca far away.</p>
<p>“An-another Dhu Gaita?” Raja asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” I said.</p>
<p>Our town was at a crossroad of many trading routes, not unlike the later-built Istanbul to the west. Many a trail joined the only road through these mountains, and brought to us a wide assortment of people. Arabs, Song people, Tibetan monks, all stopped here in a sea of languages. Once came two yellow-haired white men in ring mails and shields embossed with huge crosses. They claimed to be separated from their army, and wished to rest before they continued their way. In the evening they ranted about “Yahweh” and capturing Jerusalem. But a few cups of wine persuaded them to shed their armors and stay for good, all “Holy Wars” forgotten.</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>When he knocked on the stone door frames, Raja was shaking. I turned around, muscle tearing from years of immobility, and met his piercing gaze.</p>
<p>My ears didn’t fail me much. There the stranger stood, with an eagle on his left shoulder. What a magnificent creature it was, with spiky downs crowning its head! Its tawny body glowed with a solemn and majestic aura. The stranger was much more humble than the eagle. His heavy cloak and hood were made from a coarse fabric, whitish-gray and trimmed azure. His sack was wrapped around from his left shoulder down to under his right arm. He fiddled with an amulet around his neck, which had clanged against the black metal clasps down his chest.</p>
<p>“May I enter? You were the only people who stirred.” His voice was soft and quiet, and was underlined with a twang like a metallic chord being plucked lightly, a tad cool, but pleasant and civil. He spoke without accent the archaic tongue we spoke, though his amber black eyes, rippling with politeness of the Song people from the East, told me he was no Arab.</p>
<p>I pushed myself up as though hypnotized. For a long moment neither of us spoke. He frowned and fiddled with the amulet again and asked, “May I enter?” The voice didn’t change, but the words were Persian now. Did the amulet change his speech? I stared on.</p>
<p>“Dhu Gaita?” Raja spoke hesitantly. He fiddled the amulet again.</p>
<p>“Dhu Gaita… What about my hood?” He returned to Arabic and removed his hood. I searched his face for familiarity, but failed. His features were delicate, but marred by the scars and pimples. There was an air of quiet sadness, as though he was in mourning. He looked much worn from the journey, battered, even, by the harsh mountain winds of the season. Yet, he stood, steady and with a hint of pride outside the doorway.</p>
<p>“Please… Come in.” I said at last, each word felt stranger than the last. He bowed his head, and entered to find a spot to sit inside. He looked about the room, from the lofty patterned tiles to the spider-webbed corners, then to our mats and rugs and cushions, all faded in color. Raja sat up, too, and the mat we laid on showed two vivid human shapes. The stranger chuckled at this. The eagle clicked his beak, and he looked to the direction it nodded. His eyes widened at the shelves of scrolls next room.</p>
<p>“You are Matir Hikmat then, the scribe?” He asked me.</p>
<p>“Father is three houses east. I am his son, Nadim. But a scribe nonetheless.” I replied. He nodded. “This is Raja, my wife.” He nodded again. “You are…?”</p>
<p>“Ómaenca.” He bowed his head. I couldn’t think of such a word in any language I knew. “A pilgrim.”</p>
<p>“If you’re here for our mosque, I’m afraid you’re a few centuries too late.” I murmured. He shook his head, smiling. He offered us a piece of bread. We refused. He started munching, feeding bits to the eagle.</p>
<p>“So… about my hood—“ He started.</p>
<p>“I apologize, Ómaenca. I mistook you for someone else.” Raja replied. “He was like you, but… different…”</p>
<p>“As far as the hood goes?” His eyes flickered from her face to mine and back. “Will you tell me more about him? Perhaps… also what happened to the town?”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“The town is a crossroad of many trading routes, not unlike the later-built Istanbul to the west. Many a trail joined the only road through these mountains, and brought to us a wide assortment of people…”</p>
<center> † </center>

<p><em>Dhu Gaita</em>, “the Hood” in Arabic, was one of our much stranger travelers. He came with a few merchants met along the way one wintry day. We had seen many with hoods, but never with such a stature. His long golden hair hung down in sheets of silk, his skin white like the clouds floating above in a clear day. Every single feature of his face seemed to be sculpted with uttermost care and precision: those emerald eyes reflected a faraway forest in spring, and the straight, marble nose pointed to the thin lips pursed tight above a slightly sharp chin. The face was thin, but not famished. It looked pleasant, yet it emitted melancholy in ripples. Father said he was a man conceived through Math, that every limb and organ was in the golden ratio. I thought him an angel from Allah. As he helped his companions unload, graceful and delicate, he chatted lightly but smiled not so much. One by one, people paused to watch. Young girls glanced at him secretly from their bent down heads, but young boys and older women gawked openly. Men went over to help, and sized him up and down.</p>
<p>He always joined our early communal prayer, sitting in his hood while everyone else sat in their turbans and hijabs. He was a wanderer, always off to the mountains first thing after prayer and breakfast, not reappearing until sundown dinnertime.</p>
<p>He helped the farm hands or walked in the mountains or the town. He glided like a dream walker, cool and detached. But if anyone showed any interest in him or his hood, he would smile, warm and kind. He often asked about old legends and stories, and taught us more skillful arts in return. Many of the decorations that still remained today are wrought through his techniques. Girls on their edge of their childhood followed him everywhere. One let slip his nickname “Dhu Gaita”. He adopted this with gratitude: “Why not, if it is a name given to me without spite?”</p>
<p>A year after his arrival, Dhu Gaita came to visit us. Mother dropped her half-finished pottery bowl and father blotched his Kufic characters when they turned at his knock at the entrance.</p>
<p>“Master Hikmat, may I come in?” He asked in a voice like silk on glass, without a hint of accent. Together we sat cross-legged in our shelf-lined study, and talked about our long line of scribes in the family, masters of Kufic style. One of us learnt Math from one of the Athenian scholars generations ago, and later, astronomy from the Han people (long ancestors of the Songs). It was because of this that we had developed a technique extremely strict with our characters: the thickness of our strokes, the length of the tails, the ratio between the height and the width of words—the words are Allah’s words, and they represent the world—the Truth. The better we imitate the Truth, the closer we are to Allah. It took years to master them. There was a piece that every son or daughter must copy from their father or mother without any variation—</p>
<p>“May I have a copy?” He asked. “Will you write it for me? I will pay generously.”</p>
<p>“Of course! Why—“</p>
<p>“I can do it!” I piped up. “I’ve been practicing it for thirteen years, ever since I was old enough to hold a reed pen.” Father looked at me for a long time.</p>
<p>“You are fifteen, after all. It would be quite a trial. Master Dhu Gaita, what say you?”</p>
<p>“I am delighted.” Dhu Gaita bowed his head.</p>
<p>Father couldn’t hide his pride when, a week later, I handed my work to Dhu Gaita, who smiled his faint smile.</p>
<p>“What is a sufficient payment, young master?”</p>
<p>A thought came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“A strand of your hair.”</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>Ómaenca raised one eyebrow and tilted his head. He asked,</p>
<p>“Did you?”</p>
<p>I jumped, having almost forgotten about him.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Can I see it?”</p>
<p>“Father was rather furious. He said I had asked for too much, to mar the hairs of Allah’s angel.” I indicated the strings that hang around Raja’s and my necks. Their colors never faded.</p>
<p>“It was taken and given without spite.” Ómaenca nodded and grinned. “Now I understand what you meant by he was ‘like me but different’. Thank you.”</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>Dhu Gaita disappeared two days later. I saw him at the minaret, and around it he walked once. At a spot that faced the mihrab he passed right through. The tower was decorated with words from the Quran. I walked up to it and studied the characters closely for the first time. Where he had gone in was the word “Allah”. Like the rest of them, it was written in a form I knew by heart: the perfect ratio and thickness of the strokes, gold and outlined in silver, penned possible only by the hand or hands of my forefathers. The marble tiles had been solid as they should be, and solid they were under my fingers. How did he go in? Where did he go? I looked at the tip of the minaret. The tip looked back.</p>
<p>Everyone else thought he had left in the dark.</p>
<p>I reached 16 two months after that, and fell for Raja, who was two days younger. She was one of those girls who never forgot about Dhu Gaita. To make her smile, I cornered her one day and told her what I had seen. She begged me to take her to the spot to see and to tell her the story again, and every day after that.</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>“Talk about great pick-up lines—“ Raja giggled. “‘Hey, want to hear about Dhu Gaita again?’”</p>
<p>Ómaenca chuckled and I couldn’t help but crack a smile. It felt good to laugh again. Strange, but good. It reminded me of why I liked Raja.</p>
<p>“I paid for my lust, of course.” I kissed Raja. “She had an old hag of a grandmother who barked at everyone, cursing them in the name of Allah. A stroke amidst one of those outbursts brought her to her back in the street. I had waited until she looked like she had only a day left before proposing to Raja. But…”</p>
<center> † </center>


<p>…she just stayed that way, unconscious in her death-cushions, getting no better or worse.</p>
<p>No one died at all that year, nor were any babies born. Greetings from afar became the same “You kept well”s and “You did not change at all”s. Indeed, no one changed. No one seemed to have aged. Raja’s grandmother never died.</p>
<p>It took us five years to finally realize that something was not normal. One of those two outsiders—the ones who had exchanged their swords for ploughs—started to bald. Their children, however, didn’t grow, just like ours. Whispers spread that we were not aging anymore, and when finally we acknowledged it as a fact, the whole town ran wild. Imagine: from Egyptian pharaohs to Chinese emperors, with their mummies and philosopher’s stones and alchemy pills, what they had sought, we received without effort! Tears were wept in joy during prayers, and a festival was held. Immortality! Perhaps this was what Allah rewarded us for our devotion and hospitality! What can we do with a <em>lifetime</em>! We joyed day and night—we refused to tire. In ecstasy we dropped all rules. On the seventh day of the festival a girl ripped off her hijab and let her hair fly; boys chased after her. On the twelfth day many stepped out of their robes to dance “in [their] true selves under Allah’s eyes, like how they came to be.” A month later, we forsook all laws of abstinence and wild young couples thrashed about in the streets. Laughter and cries reverberated around the peaks like beasts’. Travelers joined the festivities in the beginning, but as time passed, as we became negligent to our duties, as the trading post was no longer cared after, they started to avoid us. Pilgrims declined our water. Merchants would speed past our trading post. Those who stayed overnight hurried away at the faintest dawn crack. </p>
<p>When the craze finally subsided, things were never the same again. Words flew, and we became monsters in the outsiders’ eyes—it was two months straight of unchecked hedonism without food or water, after all. Few stopped here. They shook their heads as they passed our roads, and some recited Quran. We disregarded them like Sodomites with Lut ibn Haran. We cared no wrath from Allah; <em>he</em> made us immortal. It was <em>his</em> gift.</p>
<p>Those two outsiders died in the last bandit raid. Raids were rare, and when they happened, every able body took up arms. This time, even children of ten were geared up with rakes. They wouldn’t die, anyways. The two outsiders didn’t hesitate to defend the town. But they were not in their prime anymore: white had claimed their hairs like rust had conquered their armors. Their sword dented with every clash and they fell, though not before taking out seven bandits each. We avenged them. We were hacked down, but with teeth and claws we demolished the bandits all, leaving the town a field of blood. Bodies were burnt, but those of our friends’ were buried on top of the highest peak.</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>“So the bandit died.” Ómaenca said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He frowned.</p>
<p>“Are they born here, in the mountains?”</p>
<p>“No.” Raja shook her head.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Please, continue.”</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>Years after that, the Imam stood on his minbar to lead the communal prayer as usual.</p>
<p>“Such are they who defied our Lord, who will have shackles on their necks, who—“ He paused. “Such are the unbelievers of our Lord, with shackles on their necks; they—“ He took a breath, “they—“</p>
<p>The Muezzin, the prayer-caller, on the other side of the hall tried to help him, “these defiers of… Allah… shackled by their necks, they shall be the… the—“ but he couldn’t go on, either.</p>
<p>Nobody could remember what came next. The Imam then bravely decided to jump to the next sura, asking pardons a thousand times.</p>
<p>Such an incident happened again weeks later, and again after that. It repeated until no one, along with the Imam could remember a single verse of the Quran. We flipped through our own copies until the pages were torn, but we just could not remember. For a long time, we prayed with our verses before us, and the pages eventually faded and disintegrated. My father and I tried our best to keep up, writing new Qurans every day, but with our technique, it took time, and nobody wanted to break the tradition. It took a few years, but eventually, prayers every day became the same verses on the mihrab niche and the prayer rug and the minaret behind us: “Praise to Allah, Lord of the Worlds…”</p>
<p>The same thing happened during Eid al-Fitr. We dusted our house, but we couldn’t remember why we put out rugs at the doors. Something should be done, but what? We gathered as usual, reading sura off the prayer rug. Then we danced, or, tried to. Our arms swung and feet tapped, but they had neither rhythm nor grace. Songs trailed off halfway through, leaving only music playing, lifeless and halfhearted. We couldn’t enjoy them anymore. We forgot how or why to enjoy them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before entertainments disappeared from our town. Life became repetitive cycles of praying and working and sleeping, and gradually to only working and sleeping. We couldn’t remember why we worked, even, with nobody ever stopped at our trading post. I tried to break my cycle with new calligraphy styles: Kufic, Naskh, Thuluth, and even the wildest style of Muhaqqaq, I mastered them all, and too soon, they lost their appeal.</p>
<p>Some of us became merchants and went out to trade. Our craftsmen tried to carve figurines and stuccos like Dhu Gaita had taught them, but they could only manage wilted flowers and lifeless birds. Much later, when the pieces became downright distasteful, their popularity suddenly grew in the West. We couldn’t understand why, but these were exchanged for new things called “firearms”. It was said to be a solution to our problem. We tried the firearms on our sheep, and then eagerly on ourselves. The bullet came and went, leaving behind a hole grown back in days. These firearms now rust in the bottom of our well.</p>
<p>Ennui drove a few of us mad. When leaping down the peaks and drowning in the well failed us, we turned to beheading. A fight broke out to decide who was to be the lucky one. In the confusion a head came rolling. We celebrated this death, and placed the head back to the body, and lit a pyre fire for good measure.</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>I felt thirsty. I went into the back room and scooped century-old wine from jars. One tasted sour, another had no tastes at all.</p>
<p>“So… is that man dead, now?” Ómaenca asked when I sat down.</p>
<p>“His head cried out in the fire.” I said. Ómaenca look rather amused. “Days later he climbed down from the char, a seam on his neck.”</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>We waged war against Life ceaselessly; Sisyphus’ turmoil was nothing compared to ours. Life became an abyss to fall through, and down we fell, on our backs in our mat, as still as the dead. Travelers came from the West route in bizarre clothes and hacked away at our trading post. They felled our mosque and left one or two of their bodies rotting under the stone. Those remained found our girls and women, who allowed themselves to be defiled, all dignities lost.</p>
<p>We dreamt. I dreamt of days eons ago, of the reed pen, the minaret, the two outsiders, and of Raja begging for stories, stories of Dhu Gaita. It all started after he walked into that wall. He must be the cause. But I couldn’t be angry at him. Not only had I lost all emotions, but what can I do about it, at all? He’s dead already.</p>
<p>Everything was chiseled away by Time, except that minaret and us. We lived in dreams, died in there, too. Then we woke up to a nightmare of eternal day. If only we could weep.</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>Ómaenca was staring at the floor, silent for a long time. When he looked up his face wore an unfathomable expression. Pity? Sympathy? Disdain?</p>
<p>“Looks like you learnt the truth about life the hard way.” He smiled a little. I sighed.</p>
<p>“You cannot live without death.” Raja whispered.</p>
<p>“I have to ask you something.” He continued after a while, “I-It’s what I came for.” We waited. “Can you… Can you write for me what you wrote for Dhu Gaita?”</p>
<p>My first instinct was to say no. It has caused us much last time. But on a second thought, he might fix it…</p>
<p>“Are you going inside, too?” I found my voice quivering. He nodded. “Take us with you.”</p>
<p>“I can try.” He looked grim. “I know what you want, though I can’t guarantee you that. But if you don’t help me, I cannot even try to help you.”</p>
<center> † </center>

<p>Dizziness was the first thing that hit us, not the sun. It took me four weeks to prepare. Most of the older scrolls had crumbled or faded, and I hadn’t touched a reed pen since I had laid down. I could only trust my hand. Before we left, Ómaenca muttered to his eagle in a tongue I’d never heard before, swift and soft; the eagle then took off as Raja grabbed hold of me, and I to Ómaenca. Together we fell to his pace, slow and firm.</p>
<p>“So… your name. What language is it?”</p>
<p>“Heh. Quenya.” He said no more.</p>
<p>We stopped at the minaret. Ómaenca unrolled the scroll and fingered the letters, counting the lengths in dots. I let go of him and he started walking. First clockwise, then counterclockwise, and clockwise again, shaking his head. He stopped at the side facing the mihrab, and reached out.</p>
<p>He froze, staring at his hand halfway into the word “Allah”, eyes reflecting the sunlight, the marble, and the wind. He lifted his foot, and I grabbed him again just as he stepped through the wall.</p>
<p>The wall bloomed and the air rippled. We emerged from the confusion to a flight of stairs. Sunlight poured in from above and through the white minaret walls. The wall behind us was solid as ever.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, you have his hairs, and me.” Ómaenca chuckled. “That’s why you can enter. Come.”</p>
<p>We felt our way down. The stairs winded in a huge spiral, covering large depth but not making one dizzy. Soft glow came before us at the last few steps, the stairs widened into a corridor. Crystal orbs floated in niches on the walls like miniature suns. White marble with sandstone ran down the hall on both sides and the ceiling. The floor was of a glassy obsidian, but a marble path, as wide as the stairs, went down the middle.</p>
<p>“This is well-kept.” Ómaenca whispered.</p>
<p>The obsidian floor ended in a circular chamber, submerged in a soft, ethereal, white light that wavered like liquid from the high ceiling above. In the middle was a white sarcophagus surrounded by four snow-pure statues of beings like Dhu Gaita. The bust in a robe lying atop of it was of equal beauty, but more realistic; I feared it would wake up. Around the walls were empty shelves. There were niches between them, where stone thrones were perched within. A few steps before us was a battered tome on the floor. I picked it up with ginger fingers, trying to read the flowing script within.</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> is one of the scripts for Quenya written there.” Ómaenca murmured, looking over my shoulder. “Lost to ages, known now only by a selected few.”</p>
<p>“Like whom?” Raja asked, peering at the symbols.</p>
<p>Ómaenca pointed.</p>
<p>“Dhu Gaita.”</p>
<p>We turned. The sarcophagus was no tomb, but an altar; the bust was made not of stone but flesh. It was the same, real robe he had worn that day that was wrapped around him now. He seemed to be sleeping, full of peace and bliss in that liquid light. His hands were folded over the grip of a dagger produced from the middle of his chest. There was no blood.</p>
<p>“The book was his. He’s an elf, him.” Ómaenca started. “A race with a lifespan seven times ours.”</p>
<p>“An elf?” Raja and I asked.</p>
<p>“An elf. When they die,” Ómaenca circled the altar, “their souls go to their Blessed Land, where they would live, die, and reborn, forever locked in this cycle. To them, they are immortal. Death is a mere new life.</p>
<p>“Old story tells of a true-death seeker, who had grown tired of living and wished for no Blessed Land at all. He had come upon a ritual for death that involved this shrine, and he, like I have, traveled far and wide in search for it. He disappeared about 200 years after he first started the journey. Now we know why. Elf civilization has ceased to flourish for thousands of years, and to be able to locate this place almost 1000 years ago… He was really resourceful.”</p>
<p>“‘Like you have’?” I repeated. “Are you… looking for death, too?”</p>
<p>Ómaenca took the tome from me and rifled through it for a moment.</p>
<p>“It takes much to disintegrate an elf’s soul. Poor old fool… His dagger is literally sucking the degradation process of your souls into his own.” He knelt before the altar and examined Dhu Gaita’s face, his eyes full of disdain. “He found his true death, alright, but at the cost of your suffering. The most notorious elf in history, shunned by even the Nanwens…” He muttered.</p>
<p>“I can’t blame him.” Raja said. Ómaenca glanced at her.</p>
<p>“What if I tell you that he was fully aware of the consequences?” He sat down beside the altar and shook the tome. “This is his journal.”</p>
<p>Did I blame him? After centuries of ennui, I understand the appeal. Yet, he knew… Such cruelty hidden beneath such beauty! But what could we do about it? Nothing.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Ómaenca.” I sat down on the floor and buried my face in my hands. Raja leaned on my shoulder. “Knowing why we cannot die is the best comfort we can have.”</p>
<p>“There is an easy fix.” We looked up. “Just remove the dagger. It’s the conduit that’s taking away your degradation.” He looked away. “But I don’t want to touch it. If you will do the favors.” He backed away and spread an arm to the altar.</p>
<p>Raja and I exchanged a look. Her big eyes were teary. With another glance at me, she crossed the chamber and pressed her lips to the Hood’s forehead. Clasping her fingers around the dagger, she pulled. Dhu Gaita didn’t budge. Raja froze, dagger lifted high, her eyes on its sharp edge. Ómaenca gazed at her, calm and steady.</p>
<p>“Just lay it beside him.”</p>
<p>But Raja kept still, eyeing the blade longingly. I knew what was on her mind, for I, too, had the same thoughts. If that dagger could truly kill Dhu Gaita, however it did it, then it could do the same for us.</p>
<p>“Please don’t.” Ómaenca said.</p>
<p>Raja started to tremble.</p>
<p>“Your time will come. I promise.” His voice was quiet.</p>
<p>Tears ran down Raja’s cheeks.</p>
<p>“Raja.” He said, his eyes sad. “You don’t want to miss out on living in full.”</p>
<p>She shut her eyes and cast the dagger aside, as though stung by it.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Ómaenca bowed his head and walked onward, not looking back. “Life with natural death at the end is a beautiful thing, and rebirth has nothing to do with it.”</p>
<p>I took Raja’s hand and followed, suppressing an impulse of snatching the dagger off the floor as I passed it.</p>
<p>Another corridor was at the other side, dark and sloped upwards. At its end Ómaenca lifted a tile, and we climbed out from the mihrab niche of the ruined mosque.</p>
<p>The eagle landed on his shoulder with a screech as we reached our house.</p>
<p>“Food.” Ómaenca pointed to sacks that weren’t there before. “Also seeds. More will come. We can start life anew now.”</p>
<p>The next day, people stirred and got up. They came and visited us, baffled about this long-absent hunger and thirst they felt. Spring arrived abruptly on the third day. We started plowing the fields on the side of the mountains and along the valleys on the fourth, and Ómaenca joined in, too. Seeds were planted on the fifth, and five people, each one an angel, arrived on the sixth. They greeted Ómaenca with warmth, and one by one, the six of them walked through the minaret.</p>
<p>On the seventh day, at the crack of dawn, Raja’s grandmother died.</p>
<p>“I would like to keep Dhu Gaita’s tome.” Ómaenca said after the pyre. Raja and I nodded.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Ómaenca,” I said, “how do you know all this? Why did you come after Dhu Gaita?”</p>
<p>“My friends there are elves.” He motioned towards the angels. “I’m doing them a favor.”</p>
<p>“And you…?” Raja leaned forward.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The five elves stayed for a year, but Ómaenca left on the tenth day. We never met again. They appeared in my life so briefly, like a breeze, and went without a trace. I wish I were ephemeral to this world as they were to me. But I, at least, can finally enjoy my life now. You live only when you can die, and my time will come.</p>
