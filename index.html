        <p>Lindsay wasn't a stranger to audio players. She remembered on one of her visits to her grandparents', her grandpa had pulled the blanket off of their new gramophone. How fascinating--almost magical!--to hear slightly muffled melodies flow out of that giant trumpet. Lindsay had wished she could have more time with it, but her little sister, Ann, was enticed. Whenever they visited, Ann'd be glued to the chair next to the giant thing. It wasn't long before she had discovered how to record her own voice. thankfully, their grandma decided that either Ann was being too noisy or her breaking three vinyls and five needles was too much, and locked the behemoth up in a cabinet. Ann would definitely love the portable music player. Tiny, no brittle vinyl discs or delicate needles, eye-catching design and colors---how could anyone not find it appealing?---If it wasn't for the 700 credits price tag.</p>
<p>The apprentices' monthly stipend for Lindsay was exactly that much. In the six months she had been at the Academy, she did manage to save, but that was for something practical, like a fur cloak for the upcoming winter.</p>
<p>Every time she passed the Depot, Lindsay would pop by the display case holding the music players, and she would tell herself, "next goal, then," and leave.</p>
<center>
#
</center>
<p>Three months after telling Lindsay about the portable music player, and thus starting Lindsay's weekly Depot visits, Tina saved enough to get one. Instead of relief from her constant pining for that "metal lipstick", Lindsay found herself being bombarded by Tina's radiant excitement about some new function she had figured out.</p>
<p>"It can connect directly to my mind!" Tina exclaimed one dinner. "It generates what's akin to programmed auditory hallucination, and thus gives the best audio quality and user experience."</p>
<p>"That's awesome. Hey, Tina, have you told Robbie about this?" Lindsay smiled rather weakly.</p>
<p>"Of course. You think I can come up with words like 'programmed auditory hallucination' and 'thus' and 'user experience'?"</p>
<p>"'Portable music player' sounds like a mouthful <em>and</em> an earful. Let's just name it." Lindsay stabbed her fork into her spaghetti over and over. "How 'bout 'Billy'? So every time we talk about this thing, he'll show that stupid face he makes."</p>
<p>Tina blinked.</p>
<p>"What face? He's got a poker face." Tina fidgeted the knob on the music player. Lindsay shrugged. "Hey, check this out. Billy is a crybaby." Tina held out the device to Lindsay, and it repeated in her voice,</p>
<p>"Billy is a crybaby."</p>
<p>Lindsay shot up in her seat, not sure due to shock, amazement, or annoyance.</p>
<p>"What do you--- I mean, how did you speak through that? Did Aura teach you that?"</p>
<p>"No, no, no, young Lin." Tina gloated with a satisfied grin. "<em>That</em>, is a recording."</p>
<p>Lindsay gaped at the device, then at Tina. A shiver of excitement slid down her back. <em>Recording...? Of course! It's like a gramophone! That means I---</em></p>
<p>"Cool, right? I know." Tina nodded fondly at it. "I was lying in my bed and I thought..."</p>
<p>Lindsay heard none of it. Recording---if she could record a training session, then she would have everything she needed to prove her suspicion about Guoben, Billy's mentor. <em>But heck! 700 credits!</em> Lindsay nodded at the animated blur that was Tina with feigned interest. <em>hmm.</em> The blur came back into sharp focus.</p>
<p>"It's brilliant. Hey, you know what'd be fun?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Wanna see how clumsy stupid Billy is during his training sessions?" Lindsay motioned at the music player with her chin.</p>
<p>"What, you want to record it? This only records <em>sounds</em>. Crybaby hardly <em>talks</em>."</p>
<p>"But he might cry." Lindsay shrugged her brows. "Bullying him into crying would be too low for us, but if he cries when he fall---"</p>
<p>"Oooh..." Tina grinned, eyes narrowing. "You think he'll do that, huh..." She nodded, slow. "But---"</p>
<p>Lindsay kept smiling with an effort.</p>
<p>"---I'm going off-world with Aura tomorrow." Tina looked away.</p>
<p>"Oh right." Lindsay sighed. She kept forgetting Tina had already started field missions. That was how she could buy the portable music player so fast---skipping meals also helped, though. Lindsay forked some spaghetti. She needed evidence to prove her suspicion, and the longer she pushed this off, the more bruises Billy had to suffer. <em>Well, maybe I can split the payment or ask for a refund or something... Oh forget about the cloak.</em></p>
<p>"Know what, take the MP. I wanna hear it when I get back on Monday." Tina beamed. "Make it good."</p>
<p>"MP?" Lindsay swallowed a forkful of spaghetti, along with her musings, anxiety, relief, and the slight peeve at Tina's gleeful expression.</p>
<p>"For 'music player'. You wanted me to name it, didn't you? 'MP', then."</p>

        <p>"Well hello there. What's this?" Christina taps at a display case. It houses a few small, rectangular devices, about the size of a lipstick. White, red, blue, gold, silver, and black, all metal-built and boast a small knob wheel barely poking out at the top. On one side, there are three buttons, and on its opposite, there is a sliding switch. The side facing up has a glass-covered slit. This, Christina recognizes, is a hologram projector.</p>
<p>This is her first time stepping into the technology section of the depot in the Ereldar Academy. She wouldn't be here had Robert not took an interest in one of those "computers". Clothing and accessories---those are her only interests. All the wires and switches and plugs and screens and thingamajigs are boys' things, not for her. She was perfectly content to linger at the entrance and wait for Robbie like a bored girl. Perfectly content---until these "lipsticks" caught her eyes.</p>
<p>"Should have worked harder in the Quenya class, hmm, Tina?"</p>
<p>Christina jumps at her mentor's voice, whose golden braid swings into view. Her eyes follow the strands up and meets the light chiding grin.</p>
<p>Tina tuts and stomps.</p>
<p>"Stop reading my mind, Aura!"</p>
<p>"More efforts in Telepathy Art training could have helped, too, hmm?"</p>
<p>Tina looks away, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>"Read the label. 'Portable music player'." Aura points at each word.</p>
<p>"Like a tiny gramophone?" Christina glances at Robert poring over a table booklet. Of course he has no trouble reading those elven letters. He's smart.</p>
<p>"Like a tiny gramophone." Aura nods and turning Tina's face toward her. "Remember to face your interlocutor, Tina." She sounds a little stern and exasperated, then goes back to an easy tone. "This is the latest design; I heard that the R&amp;D upgraded the processing unit. These can transcode more formats now, and handle larger libraries---"</p>
<p>"Whoa whoa whoa, master." Tina holds up her hands. "I just turned eleven and we don't have this outside!"</p>
<p>"Here's the older version." Aura sighs adn pulls out a thin slab of metal from her pocket. One entire side of it is a glass screen.</p>
<p>"How'd you not lose this? It's even smaller than my palm!"</p>
<p>"When I go on missions, Tina," Aura crouches down and taps the screen. It lights up, showing an image of three buttons and a slider, "I like to browse the music stores, if they have one. I sample some of their music, and buy the ones I like."</p>
<p>"Is that where you disappeared off to that one time I had to pack everything up myself?"</p>
<p>"Tina, focus." Aura lays a hand on Tina's shoulder. <em>You were packing your own equipment for most part, too.</em> "When I get back, I turn the music into a language this player can understand, so it can play them back to me. That process is called 'transcoding'." Tina nods. Aura knows there's a question coming up on how transcoding works. She stops her with one upheld finger and continues, "If the world does not have a music store, I can also record songs with this, and play it back later." Aura places her palm under Tina's and activates the holographic projection. She scrolls the list. "These are called 'shelves', and inside them are the songs and music I have collected. We call all of these a 'library', similar to a real library. The size of the library is limited by the processing unit, you see. That is the brain of this player."</p>
<p>"How?" Tina flips the device over and over, holding it up to light.</p>
<p>"The more songs I have, the slower it takes to recall and display them."</p>
<p>"Oh I know how that feels." Tina hands back the device. "I can't recall the first Quenya words I learned, the more I learn." She taps the display case again. "So these can catalog more songs? Is that why they are bigger? Why do they have, like, <em>button</em> buttons, not like your <em>screen</em> buttons? What's that wheel for? How do you play music? How do you put songs in them? What does it sound like---" Tina stifles her mouth and stops herself from bouncing in excitement. <em>Her</em>? Interested in this "portable music player" thing? Really? Tina blushes.</p>
<p>"Oh? You find this device... what is that word you always use again---"</p>
<p>"<em>Cool</em>!" Tina can't stop herself. "I don't know why--- but it is! How much---?" She studies the label, brows furrowed. her wide eyes shoots around for Robbie, then back at the label. Her lips moves silently for a moment, making out the letters. "That's my monthly credit stipend!" She gasps.</p>
<p>"It was fifty years ago when mine came out. All those research and updates translate into the price." Aura shrugs. She stands up and takes a box from the shelf above the display cases. "Well, this is what I came for. Say, if you pass all your classes this term with 90%, I will---"</p>
<p>"I'll save up credits for this my<em>self</em>." Tina's blue eyes narrow at the display case. Then her head snaps to Aura, blushing. Her eyes flick to the box and back at Aura.</p>
<p>"Um... Can you---I wanna---I mean---"</p>
<p>"Let us go check up on Robbie, Tina." Aura holds onto Tina's shoulder, a thin smile hovering at her lips. "Then, yes, we can listen together for a spell. I am sure you will recognize a few of the songs." She shakes her head as a beaming Christina drags her to a waving Robert, a flat box tucked under his arm. Her students' joy and excitement, as aura often finds, are infectious. "Please stay silent when listening to the player, okay, Tina?"</p>
<p>"DEAL!"</p>
<p><em>Oh but of course she will not.</em></p>

<p>当东方那片森林后的天空泛起数月里第一道微光时，老纳尔嘱咐我们到村子里去。他说他特别馋鹿肉粥，让我们去买点蔬菜和佐料。然后那个精灵老头裹着暖暖和和的毳袍和鹿靴，背着他的弓和塞得满满的箭袋，转身大步流星地走向黑压压的森林。</p>
<p>艾瑞丝和我知道纳伦之星里——那座老纳尔看守的、我们现在所居住的灯塔里——不缺蔬菜。我们的贮藏室建在灯塔厚厚的墙壁里，刺骨的斯堪地纳维亚海风通过通风口来去自如，所以没有一片叶子腐烂。过去五个月里，这种事已经发生好几回了——守塔人纳菲亚斯只是在找借口让我们两个人合作。</p>

<p>When the sky behind the forest to the east glowed for the first time in months, Old Nar’ bade us off to town. He said he craved for venison stew, and we should purchase some vegetables and seasoning. The old elf then strode off to the shadowy forest with a bow and loaded quiver on his back, wrapped warm in his fur cloak and moccasin.</p>
<p>Iris and I know there are still vegetables in the Naren Star, the lighthouse Old Nar’ looks after, and where we now reside. Our larder is built into its thick walls, and has vents to bring in the frigid Scandinavian sea air. Nothing was spoiled. Like too many times in the past five months, Nar’fiius the Towerkeeper is making an excuse for us to work together.</p>

        <p>礼拜堂并不算是个做礼拜的场所——实际上，它压根就不是。在外围的古希腊立柱的环绕下，礼堂的四个入口分别坐落在建筑物的东西南北四个方向。穿过入口，便来到了宽阔的圆形大厅，环顾四周，走廊环绕了大厅的一半，通往大礼堂的六扇大门一齐敞开着。在拥挤和喧闹的人山人海里，马历恺和我向引导员亮了一下我们的校园卡，走进了礼拜堂。在这些拥挤的人群中，其中有一小部分是学生，他们要么即将毕业，要么期末考试后没有提前离校；更多的则是校外人员，包括毕业班的学生家长和镇上的居民。票价是五美元，一点也不贵（说实话，我们赠送出去的比卖出去的还多）。尽管如此，无论老少，许多人仍然穿上了他们最好的礼服，有的人系着领结，有的人还戴着宝石胸针。当然，这并不是出于对台上某些精灵族学生的敬畏，而是出于对这所学校的热爱——社区拓展、回馈社会、走出象牙塔云云，你懂的——柳溪学院已成为了小镇不可分割的一部分。</p>

<p>卡米拉没有挺过来。</p>
<p>她的情况一直没有好转过。她被带进来时发着高烧，医疗队通过抗生素和他们的精灵法术勉强将其控制到了39度以下。他们检测到她的心率和大脑活动都维持在极小值。术后48小时内，她的高烧退了，但她的心脏停跳了三次，而且每一次进行心脏复苏时需要的功率都比前一次大。在术后58小时，她的体温跌落到35度。医疗队迅速行动，却发现她体内的感染复发，细菌以惊人的速度适应了他们的药，其浓度已经足以让脑髓发炎、瘫痪。在第61小时，她停止了心跳，所有的医疗手段都无济于事。六十一小时半，她出现脑积水的症状。医疗队又奋斗了几乎两个半小时，直到艾瑞丝因为睡不踏实而起床着装，趟过浓浓黑暗来到医疗棚里。走廊里没有人，她等在急救室外，听着门帘那边传来的低沉的脚步声。她坐下，开始祈祷。孤儿院里没有人信教。于夫人不允许，她只相信自己。每个人嘴上挂着的“亲天娘”最终也只是口头禅，无论她在他们的民俗神话里担任了什么角色，她现在是帮不上忙了。</p>
<p>于是她向卡米拉祈祷，乞求她挺过来、好起来。于夫人已经不在人世，安妮不知去向，小菲也不在这里。卡米拉是唯一剩下的女孩子了——有的人是鲁比克永远替代不了的。</p>

<p>“嘿，我们能过去吗？”鲁比克走到人民大道上的自由军士兵面前，丝毫不害怕他粗犷的外表。“我妹妹和我要去趟银行。”</p>
<p>自由军的最后一道防线比艾瑞丝想象的还要忙碌。身着脏兮兮的衣服的士兵在挖着和街道差不多宽的战壕，战壕已经足够隐藏一个站立的成年人了。它沿着大街的两个方向延伸，一眼望去看不到尽头。一些穿得更暖和点的下等兵在路边喊着号子拖着重型炮车，机修工把半个身子伸进停靠的坦克下，工具箱半露在外面。鲁比克和艾瑞丝并不是今天唯一上街的平民，大街上满是像他们一样请求使用战壕过道的人。那名士兵仔细打量着他们两人，他的目光在鲁比克的脸上停留得有点太久，最终他还是侧踏一步让他们通过了。</p>

<p>当他们终于来到他们住的那条街道时，艾瑞丝和鲁比克早已淋成了落汤鸡。他们灰白色调的衣服沉甸甸地挂在身上，艾瑞丝踏出的每一步都让她感觉极端不适。她早把头发改扎成了辫子，因为原先为了不让头发遮挡视线而扎的发髻变得实在是太重。现在,她每跑一步，辫子就随之摇晃、拉扯，她只能把它紧紧抱在胸前。</p>
<p>这条街和城里其他的街道毫无差别：灰暗、坑洼遍布，里面满是泥血，尽数展示着一场遭遇战的后果——自从20年前内战打响以来，这种小规模冲突就一直折磨着这座城市，占据了艾瑞丝记事后的记忆。</p>

        <p>The Chapel is not much of a venue for religious practices—in fact, it’s not one at all. Behind the stereotypical Greek hypostyle facade of an entrance is a much wider rotunda. Three more entrances are annexed to the east, west, and north of this building. Inside, the corridor runs around half of the circumference, opening six doors in total to the great hall. In the busy and noisy crowd, Likai and I flash our IDs to the usherers, and make our way in. Some of these people are students, either graduating seniors or those who didn’t leave early after the finals. Most are outsiders—parents of the graduating class and residents from the town. Five dollars aren’t remotely expensive for a ticket (and to be frank, we gave away more than we sold). Yet many still choose to grace us in their best suits and dresses, old and young alike, a bow tie here and a jeweled brooch there. Not because of the elven students in the performance, it’s the school. Community outreach, giving back, moving out of the bubble, you get the idea. Willowcreek Academy is an integral part of the town.</p>

        <p>“<em>The Count of Mount Cristo</em>, <em>The Moonstone</em>, and… <em>The Remains of the Days</em>? That last one—you’re in for a treat, Devon. Ishiguro demonstrated a beautiful example of an unreliable narrator.” Catherine Murray gives Devon a meek smile. Devon scratches his head. The librarian knows about every book here in the library at Willowcreek Academy; he loves chatting with her. Catherine sees a question in his eyes. “The narrator isn’t always reliable, and the reader shouldn’t always trust the narrative, either, especially a first person one. Not that the narration has to be false or a lie—truths can be hidden. You might need to read the book twice to get everything out of it.”</p>
