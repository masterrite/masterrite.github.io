    <p>“We certainly weren’t <em>this</em> loud when we were freshmen.” Lily glances around the cafeteria. Wading through the chattering crowd with an empty stomach, only to find a rather cramped table for four in a corner is <em>not</em> her ideal first day of senior year in middle school. Her friends nod in agreement. “I wish it’s still summer.”</p>
<p>“Definitely not ready for school, no.” Julia pulls an extra chair over.</p>
<p>“No kidding.” Landon comes over with a slice of cheese cake, four cupcakes, and two big chunks of brownie. He hands one brownie to Max and tries to stuff the other into Julia’s mouth, and gives the cupcake plate to Lily and Mae. “I guess especially you, Mae, since you missed most of it in the Treasure Trove.”</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Mae thanks him and nods. The Treasure Trove is the bookstore not far from Mae’s house, where her mother, Catherine Murray, works. Over the summer Mae worked there part time as well. It’s one of the few things she managed to persuade her mother.</p>
<p>“I heard Mr. Mackenzie likes having you there.” Max says. Mr. Mackenzie is the balding owner of the Treasure Trove. “He doesn’t say it in front of Cate, but he tells us you’re the shop’s mascot.”</p>
<p>“Duh. Mae’s smile can melt snow. I’d have her as a mascot, too, if I were him.” Julia rolls her eyes.</p>
<p>Landon asks through a mouthful of casserole,</p>
<p>“Why are you working there again?”</p>
<p>“Make some money. Help out mom after… you know…” Mae’s face gets redder by the second, “…dad got in jail after a bar fight back in April.”</p>
<p>“Oh right. Sorry.” Landon jerks as Julia kicks him under the table.</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. It’s quiet with him gone. Working around books is nice, too. See, I’ve been thinking,” Mae taps her small chin with the handle of her fork, “I shall buy mom something… a present – with my first pay.”</p>
<p>“Good idea.” Max agrees.</p>
<p>Around them the clamor reaches its apex as students from all three grade years dig in. Freshmen argue loudly over contents from their morning classes, bragging about the little they know of the material on the last few pages of their textbooks: Plato and the Cave, Einstein and the wave-particle theory, genes and TALENs, etc. The Sophomores snigger behind their backs, throwing fugitive glances at the little know-it-alls. The seniors like Mae and her friends are too tired already to care a thing about what’s going on around them. “Why are they treating us like high school students?” They groan. “It’s not like I want to enroll in the high school department <em>here</em>.”</p>
<p>“…hmm… Dad’s out in November… I think I should get him something as well…” Mae absentmindedly sucks on the tips of her fork.</p>
<p>“What?” All four of her friends round on her.</p>
<p>“Just - nothing.” Mae bends down to her salad.</p>
<p>“So soon?” Landon and Julia ask in unison.</p>
<p>“What are you getting him?” Max asks.</p>
<p>“Hold on a moment,” Lily frowns. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Mae mumbles.</p>
<p>Mae’s father, Richard Murray, is the town of Alvar’s infamous alcoholic. Large and menacing, he fell down the water hole ever since his first factory went bankrupt ten years ago. His fall from a respectable factory manager to a despicable peasant at another factory (in his own words) was just a little too hard, it seems. It takes the stars to align for the small town of Alvar to see him sober for a month straight. His alcohol-fueled rages have even earned him a ban from the local tavern: the story goes that Bart the Bartender had to threaten him out at musket-point. He ended up seeking booze in Bennon, the nearest city, and as of April, the last bar he visited banned him, too, after he wreaked havoc inside over an argument. He went to jail. The bar went under renovation. Neither is over, yet.</p>
<p>Even without alcohol he has an ugly reputation. It’s no secret about the domestic violence in the Murray household. The neighbors are all too familiar with the cries of Catherine and Mae, as well as the sound of materials breaking: porcelain, glass, wood, metal, and even bricks in the wall. Mae used to have bruises and wounds on her arms and legs that she’d brush off with a lie, and nowadays she covers them up under sleeves and long pants or dress. Catherine is said to have shown up once in the clinic with a broken wrist and a swollen eye. The doctors aren’t fooled by her “took a fall” talk, but they can’t do anything except tending the wounds. Cate’s left eye never healed to what it was before.</p>
<p>No one in town can do anything about it: no one can get concrete evidence of his abuse. Sure, maybe Mae is underage and susceptible to threats and fear and keeps her silence, but Catherine Murray – is it religious fervor or simply Stockholm Syndrome? – never admits it, either. No one understood why, when Mae’s grandfather Ryan Murray came into town three years ago with a cricket bat after been tipped off about his son and chased Richard Murray through the streets, determined to beat him into a pulp for what he did, it was Catherine who threw her arms before the broken man to plead her father-in-law to have mercy.</p>
<p>The best the Alvarians can do, and did, is to ensure that Richard Murray never gets his hands on a gun. The police confiscated his hunting rifle years ago, and make excuses to search him whenever they meet him in the streets.</p>
<p>Mae is kind, and Lily knows that better than anyone; but to endure years of abuse and still gift her abuser is inconceivable to her. She opens her mouth and can’t find the words to shut it.</p>
<p>“He… isn’t really a good dad, is he?” Julia doesn’t like the idea of being nice to Richard Murray, either. She tries to relieve the awkwardness.</p>
<p>“He never gave <em>you</em> any presents, right?” Compared to offending Mae, Landon right now is more worried about Lily blowing up into one of her own frenzies. He has only seen it once: she was as silent before the outburst then as she is now, and that once was enough for a lifetime.</p>
<p>“We just want your first income go to people who really deserve it.” Max is earnest as always.</p>
<p>“I –” Lily starts, and immediately the other three tries to stop her,</p>
<p>“Lily!”</p>
<p>“– want to hear what you think, that’s all.” She finishes.</p>
<p>“He’s my dad. I won’t be alive has it not been for him.” Mae mumbles again.</p>
<p>Landon, Julia, and Max look from Mae to Lily to Mae and to each other, all thinking that one day Mae might <em>just</em> be alive has it not been for her father. They wait for Lily’s response, anxious. All she says softly is,</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<center>**</center>

<p>It’s the Saturday before Richard Murray’s release. Mae’s grandparents accompany her to the Bennon Mall. It’s only the first day of November, and the banners hanging from the metal frames of the huge arching skylight overhead are already prophesying the discounts and deals to come. Shoppers are everywhere. Children drag their parents into toy shops and candy stores that dot the length of the hall. Young couples and teenagers dance in and out of fashion stores. Families of two or three or more crowd the walkway or aggregate around benches. Even the bookstore looks smaller from the outside with all the people. <em>Everyone wants to start early with the Thanksgiving shopping.</em> Mae says to herself and can hardly hear her own voice in her head, so she says it over and over again.</p>
<p>This is her first time in the mall without the Liu’s. However much Lily’s parents insist that she is as good as part of the family, Mae can never fully push through the invisible wall in her mind. She feels herself ungrateful and cruel. It’s strange today, walking through the crowd, not with them and conflicting with herself but having her own burly Grandfather Ryan in the front making the way and her own plump Grandmother Diane beside her offering an arm. Under the canopy of banners blaring “THANKSGIVING WARM-UP SALE” and “5% OFF IN &#x2F;C***** &#x2F;K****”, Mae thinks that perhaps this is what shopping with her own mother might be in another world. If she was the type she might even pine at her mother or grandmother for some pretty coat or a pair of shoes in the display window. Bottom line: Mae doesn’t have to avoid looking at other families in the mall anymore.</p>
<p>“Great Scott, what a blasphemy. Where’s the Christmas songs already!” Grandma Diane says in Mae’s ear. “Remember, back in ‘94, you listen to Christmas songs on November 1st.”</p>
<p>“Oh shucks, old girl,” Grandpa Ryan turns around and walks backwards, “‘94! <em>‘94</em> - on our first date in <em>‘64</em> they played Carla Thomas before Halloween –”</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to him, dear.” Grandma Diane tugs Mae close and says in a carrying whisper, “We were <em>not</em> dating when we were six.”</p>
<p>“Psh! Come over to gramps, Mae, and tell us, anyone you fancy back in Alvar –”</p>
<p>“Be a gent and go on make way for the ladies, you!” Grandma Diane waves her hand.</p>
<p>Embarrassed, Mae blushes. She is always scared of conflicts, and shies away even from minor disagreements. But she doesn’t mind the old couple bickering somehow. It isn’t like her father yelling drunkenly at her mother, rather, more like Landon and Julia - it’s cute. Perhaps this is what her friends will be like in 50 years. <em>And hopefully not with a granddaughter abused by their son.</em> She thinks.</p>
<p>The cloud passes by the sun in the azure sky outside, and they come to a fashion store.</p>
<p>“Really?” Mae peers questioningly into the interior. In the brightly-lit space, a sea of shelves and racks bearing clothes in the style of, deeper and deeper in, casual, business-casual, business, sports, and undergarments.</p>
<p>“Of course. We buy our own clothes here.” Grandpa Ryan says.</p>
<p>“Old soot has quite an eye for fashion still.” Grandma Diane pats Mae’s arm.</p>
<p>Mae has to agree. The store is packed with mostly young people too hip for her to look at. They are joyous and loud, moving their limbs in exaggerated ways – the sort of people that one might see in fashion commercials. So <em>this</em> is where they get to look the part.</p>
<p>“We’ll get Charlie’s with Ryan’s. They wear the same size – you, my dear, we ought to get you something, too.” Grandma Diane nods.</p>
<p>“What - no, you don’t have to –”</p>
<p>“It’s our call here, dear.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t know how –”</p>
<p>“Pick whatever you fancy. Your mother has some weird ideas about ‘daily attires’, as she says. Not that she doesn’t about other things –” Grandpa Ryan says.</p>
<p>“Ryan!” Grandma snaps.</p>
<p>“Anyways, pick something that’s not gray or ‘austere’. Off you go. We’ll be over there.”</p>
<p><em>Grandpa doesn’t like mom much, huh.</em> Mae thinks as she browses the racks and models. <em>How did mom even get married to dad?</em> She realizes that she knows almost nothing about her parents: what they were like as children, how they met, and how her father came to be who he is today. Maybe he used to be one of the rowdy teens in the crowd behind her, cracking jokes with his friends and girlfriend; or maybe he was like Max, quiet and honest and caring until some incident flipped him around –</p>
<p><em>Oh no, impossible. Max is nothing like him.</em> Mae frowns at the clothes. Almost every one of them looks too fashionable, and Mae has trouble imagining herself in them. Julia would fit right in for all of them, and Lily might be slightly pickier about what she puts on, but her? Eh. Poncho coats? Retro denim jacket? Leather bomber jacket? Suede coat complete with matching cashmere scarf and hat?</p>
<p>“Can I help you?” A store assistant bounces over. Mae’s face goes red at her bust.</p>
<p>“Oh, um –” Maybe she should just refuse. “I’m wondering if you have –” What should she get? “ – any coats –” Yes, a coat is suitable. <em>Pfft, “suit”-able. A coat suits.</em> She grins, embarrassed. “ – that are more – “ Mae swallows the words, “for me”. “ – I mean, <em>less</em>, um… bright?” <em>Phew.</em></p>
<p>“Less bright? I think a bright color would match your hair great! No? Well, if you insist…” The girl picks out a few coats with darker shades. Mae looks around for her grandparents. They catch her eyes and wink. <em>Okay then.</em> She sighs.</p>
<center>**</center>

<p>The best type of clothes her mother likes is the type with no decorations at all: she herself wears plain white blouse and gray dresses. The only difference between different seasons is the length of the sleeves and the thickness of the fabric. If she was at home she might also change to loose sweatpants. The most decorative clothes she (and Mae) owns are blouses with lace at seams and collar, looking like straight out of an 1800s painting. The burgundy long coat with a shoulder cape as collars that Mae chose should stand well with her: the most decorative pieces on there are the double columns of brass buttons. Mae likes its vintage-yet-updated design and the color. When she tried it on, it was a slim-fit yet not hindering her movements. The shop assistant said she had an eye for it, and Mae decided to give her the benefit of doubt. <em>It’s warm, anyways. Mom won’t talk.</em></p>
<p>As for her father… What will he be wearing when he comes back on Thursday? Will her clothes fit?</p>
<p>“Are the seats taken?” The mischievous voice is one that Mae knows well. She whisks her head up from her food and sure enough, finds herself beaming at Lily’s father. Beside him are Lily’s smiling mother and the grinning Lily herself.</p>
<p>“Not for you.” Grandpa Ryan laughs and pats the seats. “Sit down already!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think we’d meet you here!” Lily hugs Mae as Lily’s mother and Grandma Diane greet each other warmly. “Shopping, too? Wait, is it about the presents you talked about two months ago? What did you get?” Mae shows her.</p>
<p>“Sweater and thick pants for Richard. Hmm, they ought to keep him warm.” Lily’s father says.</p>
<p>“Picked them out herself.” Grandpa Ryan puffs out his chest.</p>
<p>“A bookbinding kit for Catherine?” Lily’s mother leans over.</p>
<p>“Picked it out herself.” Grandpa Ryan puffs out his chest again.</p>
<p>“I was surprised how much she knew about those crafting kits.” Grandma Diane says.</p>
<p>“Mom taught me.” Mae says simply.</p>
<p>“Anything for yourself?” Lily asks.</p>
<p>“Well… there’s the coat, but gramps and gran paid for it –”</p>
<p>“Picked it out herself!” Grandpa Ryan puffs out his chest for the third time.</p>
<p>“Say something else, idiot!” Grandma Diane slaps his shoulder. “You still have some money left, don’t you, dear? Go get yourself something.”</p>
<p><em>Buy myself something with my own money… That’s sounds so alien.</em> She thinks. It must be the possessive, <em>her own</em> money. She can’t deny it’s a good idea, though: the final cherry on the top for that feeling of accomplishment. Besides, everything she bought so far weren’t too expensive. There <em>is</em> plenty money to spare.</p>
<p>She already has a new coat, though. What else should she get?</p>
<p>“Yeah… maybe a teddy bear for a change…”</p>
<p>“Or you can get your first phone with me.” Lily suggests.</p>
<p><em>A phone, huh.</em></p>
<p>“If you do, we can switch to a family plan together.” Says Grandpa Ryan. “Like, <em>finally</em>. You know how much our current plan costs, Diane?”</p>
<p>“We should make you two her emergency contact if Mae goes for the phone. We might be too late when we get to her all the way from Bennon.” Grandma Diane says.</p>
<p>“Certainly.” Lily’s mother nods.</p>
<p><em>A phone, huh.</em> Mae considers this. Her own phone… it’d be much easier to call her grandparents if she gets one, and to contact Lily and her parents as well, if issues (<em>Dad,</em> she corrects herself) arise. Max has a phone, too… she can get his number. She smiles and nods. What’s to worry about – it’s <em>her</em> money. Besides, they’re a quarter way in to the 21st century, and she’ll be 14 next month. It’s time she joins the modern world and starts to leave her mother’s old one.</p>
<p><em>Exciting.</em>  </p>
<center>**</center>

<p>The door is ripped open and slammed shut on Thursday evening, and Mae jumps so hard that she almost drops the plate she’s washing. Trying her best to suppress the trembling of her legs, she turns halfway around to watch the hallway outside the kitchen. <em>There goes peace and quiet.</em> She sighs. <em>How should I give him the clothes?</em> Part of her says that she doesn’t want to, and that her friends were right to object in the first place.</p>
<p>There’s a “thud” as her father kicks off a boot, and is followed by huffing and low growling. <em>If it’s an effort to kick off one boot, then he’s too drunk already.</em> Indeed it doesn’t take ten seconds for the sour stench of alcohol to waft past Mae. What did she expect, really? That her father would repent in jail? That the jail would make him a new man? That her life would become a better one? Of course he would come home and leave for booze hunt right after finding his car key, if she has to guess. After another loud thud, Richard Murray stomped his way down the hall. Mae braces herself.</p>
<p>Little by little Richard Murray emerges from behind the kitchen door frame out of the dim hallway. First is his flat and straight forehead plastered with his furiously red hair roughed by wind and sweat and melted snow. Then comes the heavy and uncouth face, screwed up as he concentrated on putting one foot before the other. So what if they shaved him before his release? Whiskey and vodka put them right back onto his wide chin and square jaws in one mere hour. There’s a new bleeding scar next to his huge nose standing out against his old ones. Who shattered under his fists tonight?</p>
<p>“Welcome home, dad.”</p>
<p>His head swivels on his thick neck between his slouching shoulder and in he staggers. <em>Oh no, oh no.</em> Mae holds the plate and the sponge close. Richard Murray throws out an arm and shovels her aside. Mae hits the fridge and slides into the corner between it and the wall, ignorant of the soap water she squeezed out of the sponge in reflex. The reek off of her father is making her sick.</p>
<p>“Damn place ain’t got a mirror now?” He growls.</p>
<p><em>This isn’t the bathroom. Go away. Go away.</em> Mae thinks. <em>Go away already!</em></p>
<p>“Fucking snow. Ice everywhere. Slips. Damn fuck.” He rubs his scar looking at his reflection in the window pane. “WHY AIN’T THIS SHIT WORKING!” He strikes the window. It cracks into a spiderweb.</p>
<p><em>Go away. Go away. Thank god mom had it changed to laminated glass since last time. Go away already…</em></p>
<p>Mae’s prayer might as well as works. Her father stumbles around and out of the kitchen without looking at her. <em>Thank god all I got was a shove.</em> She goes shakily back to the sink and opens the other, uncracked window. The night air rushes in and Mae shivers. Between the cold and her father’s reek, she’d rather freeze.</p>
<p>“CATHERINE!” goes Richard Murray on the second floor. His footsteps moves closer and closer overhead. “Won’t even come out and greet me after six months? The Lius grew you guts, eh?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m sor –”. There’s a slap from directly overhead and her mother breaks off. Mae freezes.</p>
<p>“I’ll get them tomorrow! ALL of them!” Her father howls. “From that wimp to his wife to his cheeky little girl –” He rants and slurs and Mae considers shutting the window. This is no longer a choice between the stench and cold air, now.</p>
<p><em>Maybe having the neighbors hear him would help us.</em> She slides it close. <em>But then there’s mom.</em></p>
<p>“– for six months I had nothing!” and there’s a violent “thump”. Mae hears her mother squeal and the bed springs groan. She knows too well what’s happening upstairs. She feels sick. The running water helps little blocking the sounds, and very soon she finds herself locking her bedroom door, glad it’s on the first floor at the opposite end of the house.</p>
<p>On a chair next to her desk is the bundle of sweater and pants she wrapped the evening before. Perhaps she should just throw them away, or give them to her grandfather: someone, like Max said, who deserves it. </p>
<p>In the distance come her mother’s faint moan. Mae flips open the book she borrowed and tries to read. Keats usually pulls her in instantly, but not today: two layers of doors and a layer of floor can’t stop her ears from picking up the faintest of those sounds that she almost grew up with. Her mother never resists, always trying her best to live up to the “good wife” model she worships. “It’s our duty to make our husbands happy.” She said. But does she really believe in it? Lily’s mother never says that, and Lily’s father doesn’t drink like a fish, either. They are both happy. <em>But do they also–?</em> Mae screws her eyes shut, ashamed of the thought. <em>No, stop it. What am I thinking?</em> Then she can’t help but adds, <em>Where else would Lily come from… But even if they do, it’s not like dad with mom.</em> She can now hear her father cursing at her mother. It’s emanating from the wall itself. Mae pushes <em>Keats</em> away and runs to the bathroom to wash. When she finally dries herself and curls up in bed, she still feels dirty.</p>
<p>Should she call someone? It’s still not too late. Her grandparents, at least, are awake. Or perhaps Lily, or even Max. What should she say? </p>
<p><em>I’m scared.</em></p>
<p>Of what?</p>
<p><em>My dad.</em></p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p>Julia is a better person to talk to, but she doesn’t have a phone, nor Landon, who lives next to her.</p>
<p><em>I really needn’t buy that, huh. Nothing can improve my life one bit.</em> Mae covers her ears with her pillow. <em>Should’ve gone with the teddy bear.</em></p>
<center>**</center>

<p>The train pulls into Alvar Station at 5 o’clock the next day. The clouds in the grey sky look almost touching the tree tops. To the south, outside the station, the layers of roofs along the Alvar Hill are capped in snow. Mae busies herself with redoing her bun in front of a window, pulling it apart and rewrapping it, her teeth clenched tight. Landon’s face appears behind hers in the reflection.</p>
<p>“You’ll be pulling your hair out.”</p>
<p>“Don’t want to take chances.” Mae’s scalp screams at the pull but she doesn’t care. Her mother found her left the dishes from last night half-done this morning and wasn’t happy. With her father now home, she’d better make sure nothing ticks either of them off.</p>
<p>Julia catches up and winces at the last snap of the elastic band. She loosens her own ponytail in reflex.</p>
<p>“I know your mom is strict with your hair, but isn’t that too much? You’ve already redone it before we left.” She says. Mae looks at her own feet out of habit and shakes her head. “Oh right… your dad’s back.”</p>
<p>Mae nods and turns to leave the station.</p>
<p>“So… how was it last night? Did you give your dad his present?” Landon asks.</p>
<p>“Don’t want to talk about last night.” Mae mutters to the ground. Landon frowns, troubled. Julia wraps an arm around her.</p>
<p>“Talking might help you feel better. It worked before.”</p>
<p>Mae looks up into Julia’s clear, blue eyes with her green ones. Last night she wanted to do anything to tell Julia what was happening, and now she can’t bring herself to it. Perhaps it has to do with Landon be present. Perhaps it has to do with her realization that nobody can help her. Her bun feels heavy and she hangs her head again. Julia stops. She turns Mae around.</p>
<p>“Was it that bad?” She asks, worried. Mae nods. “Then come home with me for the night - I’ll convince my parents; or go to Lily’s place when they come back, if you want to.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think that’s a good idea, you stay with Julia or Lily.” Landon echoes. “Like, out of sight, out of mind. Or you can come with me. I don’t might sleeping on the couch.”</p>
<p>“I can’t always run away.” Mae says in a small voice. “And I can’t go anywhere unless dad’s away in the city.”</p>
<p>Julia makes a face. Lily would drag Mae home without a second thought. Her family accommodates Mae and her mother often whenever Richard Murray goes out for drinks at night – ever since her father was banned from Shamrock and Eagle – to help them avoid him when he come home drunk, so it’s much easier for them to stay there. Max, always considerate, would be a big help right now, too: Mae likes Max. She’d consider his words, at least. It’s unfortunate that they are coming home with their parents at the university today, and Julia would rather not manhandle her friend and force her home with her. It irritates her that she can’t do anything to help, and she doesn’t like how downcast Mae look. She sighs and gathers Mae into her arms, muttering, “Oh you, poor little bird, you…”</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine.” </p>
<p>Julia raises her eyebrows and pushes the corners of Mae’s mouth up with her fingers. She has never seen such helpless and dim eyes above smiling lips. Those big eyes blink and Mae breaks into a smile on her own. She shakes herself lose from Julia.</p>
<p>“Well, that works. A bit.” Landon says from aside.</p>
<p>“Thanks. I shall be going now.” Mae waves and turns.</p>
<p>“Call us if you need us, okay?” Julia shouts after her. “Any of us! Or our parents! Keep your phone with you, okay?”</p>
<p>Mae nods to the ground and heads uphill in quick steps. She probably ticked Julia off with her little rebellion, since she usually follows along her advice, sometimes pretending to follow to not make her feel bad. Not this time: words alone can’t change the reality, and neither can her mother nor her. <em>Why didn’t he just die in a fight or something.</em> Mae is startled by her own thought. <em>No, no… don’t think like that…</em></p>
<p>She turns onto Shamrock Road and one block later the road opens up to the Main Street. Down to her left, blocks away, are the train tracks crossing over the road that curves out of sight and connects eventually to the highway to Bennon. Up on her right is the rest of the town, layers and layers of tiered, flat rooftops, their red or black tiles poking out of the fresh snow caps from last night, paving higher and higher uphill until it meets the dark-green forest. At the hilltop, Mae can make out the white-capped dome of the Alvar Observatory. Dots of light blink on throughout the hillside, from streetlamps and windows. It’s always a sight for Mae: it’s as though the stars themselves have descended upon the town in the falling darkness, transforming it into the Fairyland. It looks cozy in the frigid air. Mae is convinced that it’s the snow-laden Alvar in the evenings that’s on so many Christmas cards out there.</p>
<p><em>Had there only a clear sky.</em></p>
<p>Everything - the houses, the cars, the people, this very town - is ready for the night. The heavy sky presses the wintry wind down and grinds it on Alvar like a useless sponge scrubbing the snow. “Forlorn”, that’s the word that comes into Mae’s mind as she surveys the view through a natural gray filter.</p>
<p>A school bus roars down Main Street, and Mae wonders briefly what it feels like to come home on that, instead of the train – what does it feel like to have a normal “home” to come back to at all? Would it be that far from packing up to go to Lily’s house for the night with her mother? She’s happy when she’s with them, happy and safe, knowing that they won’t be woken up by her father’s drunken noises or be used as his rage-vent, even though she can’t look past the fact that she’s not part of Lily’s family – she doesn’t look like them, after all; she’s nothing like them – or that she’s still more reserved around her mother and can’t act naturally, to be “herself”.</p>
<p><em>Home, huh. What does it even mean?</em> Mae crosses Main Street. She picks her way through unshoveled snow and thick sheets of ice. <em>A familiar place with familiar people? A safe and happy place to return to or, even, to hide in?</em> She nods her greeting to the plump wife of Bart the Bartender, who’s walking her granddaughter home from grocery shopping. <em>Was that what Ruth was sick for, as Keats wrote, standing in the cornfield?</em> Those plants can grow up to six feet or even more, way taller than what Ruth could be, and they’re yet to be seen on the coast of the Mediterranean in her era. Standing in the dark maze of alien plant, sick for a familiar, safe haven – <em>Keats’ brilliant.</em> – yes, that suffocation and hopelessness, Mae knows too well.</p>
<center>**</center>

<p>Her phone vibrates when Mae is almost home. It’s from Max.</p>
<p><em>Didn’t get to ask today - is everything alright at home, with your dad back and everything?</em></p>
<p>It brings a small smile on her face. She should’ve gotten <em>him</em> something instead.</p>
<p><em>It’ll be fine. I’m</em></p>
<p>She hesitates before continuing,</p>
<p><em>home. Chat later.</em></p>
<p>Her mother’s portrait of the Virgin greets her as usual. Whoever drew it must’ve tried to make her blind: her eyes are those of the dead, looking past her long nose above the small puckered mouth without a purpose or a focus. What’s <em>she</em> so sad about, anyways - giving birth to the God’s son must’ve been all women’s dream in her time. Mae avoids her gaze and hangs up her coat.</p>
<p>Catherine is in the kitchen preparing dinner, in her gray cotton dress and looking more dour than usual.</p>
<p>“Mom, I’m back.”</p>
<p>“You’re a bit late.” Her mother doesn’t sound angry.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Mae knows better.</p>
<p>“Wash your hands and come help.”</p>
<p>“Yes, mom.”</p>
<p>Does her mother really love her? Her mother did look up when she called out. On rare occasions in which Mae cuts herself while chopping, Catherine would always treat her immediately, and not without tenderness. When she was little Mae even considered injuring herself on purpose just to experience that care. <em>Is it really out of love, or is it her ‘being a good wife’ nonsense?</em></p>
<p>In the living room, her father sits spreadeagled on the couch watching TV with a scowl. Mae stands at the entrance way, about to take off her shoes and greet him before she registers what he’s wearing.</p>
<p>The new sweater and the pants fit him well.</p>
<p>He turns his head and their eyes meet, bloodshot green on clear green. One thing Mae has learned in her life is that she should never get her hopes up, but for one split second, as she half-bowed to untie her shoelaces, she is deluded with a vision of her father giving her a gruff “thanks”. She almost smiles before she realizes that the clothes should be in a package in her room, and her mother never knew about it being wrapped or placed thus. What was he searching her room for?</p>
<p>“So.” Richard Murray growls. Mae straightened up. “So.”</p>
<p>“Hi dad, I’m back.” Mae says automatically.</p>
<p>“Grew wings, eh?” Richard Murray sneers. “Making money like a big girl now, eh?” He stands up and advances, eyes narrowed. Mae trembles. “I get in for six months and already you’re making a life without me, eh, setting up your own little bank and everything?” Mae has to clench her teeth to stop them from clattering. In the kitchen, the sound of her mother’s chopping stops.  She takes a step back. “Where’s the rest of your money?” He demands. “Hand them over!” He’s drunk. The stink is faint but he’s definitely drunk. “NOW!” Mae backs off and her father presses on. “<em>DIDN’T YOU HEAR ME?</em>“</p>
<p>The kitchen light is thrown upon his menacing and scarred face, and Lily’s face blooms into Mae’s mind. Richard Murray lurches for her. Crash goes her bag onto the floor as she turns to run, slipping through his fingers and out of the front door.</p>
<p>The chilly air seeps into her clothes. She should’ve grabbed her coat. The darkness is falling fast and it’s becoming difficult to see the ice patches. Mae dares not run too slow; she does her best keeping to the snow and away from the more slippery ice. When her father is out of the door she is already at the block junction of 2nd Street and Shamrock Road. Did her mother try to stop him, or was he too drunk to turn the handle? If he was, then he might slip on the ice – It almost feels as though the sidewalk is pulled from under her. She falls and bangs her knee on the metal fence around the neighboring house. Mae scrambles to get up and the very next second she feels the steel toes of her father’s hunting boots connect with her thigh. The kick sends her sliding across the junction.</p>
<p>She is picked up by her hair the next moment and receives a sound slap, then another, and a third. They reverberated in the air and leave her ears ringing. There’s nothing she can see other than her father’s heavy face. She tries to stand: her scalp feels like tearing off her skull.</p>
<p>“<em>This’ll</em> teach you!” Richard Murray snarls. “<em>This</em> is for your damned bank! <em>This</em> for your bitchy clothes. <em>This</em> –”</p>
<p>“No, dad - stop! Please!” Mae sobs, reaching up to release her hair.</p>
<p>“<em>Give me the money!</em>“ Richard Murray screams and punches her. Mae feels like the impact ripped a muscle in her neck. She flies out of her father’s hand, collides with the cobblestone wall beside them, and lands head-first onto the sidewalk. A car skids to a halt and a man gets off, yelling,</p>
<p>“What’s going on here? Stop what you’re doing!”</p>
<p>“Help! Help me, please – ah!” Mae watches her father punch the man in the face, who bounces off his own car and slides down.</p>
<p>Mae has to get up and get away. Blood trickles down her face and pain flares across her forehead, her thigh, and her knee. She manages to raise. Richard Murray makes to follow, then turns to kick the man from the car off of his leg. He spots his daughter staggering across the road and strides over.</p>
<p>“Someone stops Richard Murray! Anyone!” The man struggles to get up and yells. Richard Murray gives a low growl and doubles back to him.</p>
<p>There’s a brief struggle. It ends with Richard Murray kicking the man in the face, knocking him out.</p>
<p>Mae loses her footing when she’s a few steps from the sidewalk. She collapses, shivering with cold and pain. Something must’ve happened to her brain when she banged her head on the ground: the world is in a vertigo and she can’t tell which way she was going towards. She crawls forward anyways: to move is to increase the odds of survival – her father lifts her up by her sweater and slams her down like a doll.</p>
<p>“Why do you hate me so much?” She blurts out.</p>
<p>“I’ll show you why!” Her father lands another kick on her back. She shrieks in pain and collapses.</p>
<p><em>That’s it.</em> She’s freezing. She’s broken. To get up requires a herculean effort she doesn’t possess. <em>That’s all there is for me.</em> Mae curls up in the middle of the road, grits her teeth, and waits to die.</p>
<p>How does it come to this, she can’t remember anymore. As her father kicks, slaps, punches, and throws her, she wonders incoherently whether she really is his daughter. Has it always been like this? Had there been happier times that she forgot? Her only memories of her father are ones of terror. Among these pieces of thoughts she cries for her mother, but who is it that she’s really yearning for? Definitely not Catherine Murray.</p>
<p>Her father’s roars stopped being intelligible long ago. How come nobody is coming out of their homes to help? Only the mister from the car tried and failed rather miserably. <em>Of course… a car isn’t a home. Home’s safe, and no idiot’s forsaking that for me. Me. Heh. Me. Understand Ruth sick for home. What a joke. Don’t have one.</em></p>
<p>She can’t feel her body anymore. She can’t feel her father’s blows, either. How many bones are broken in her body now? How many organs have ruptured from impact? How many breaths does she have left? <em>Snuff me out already.</em> She holds onto this only thought as she lies there, her red hair spreading around her under the streetlight like blood.</p>
<p><em>Mom didn’t even try to stop him. She never did.</em></p>
<p>Deep inside her, a memory breaks loose – more like a dream: a warm one, echoing with lullaby and filled with a sweet and comforting scent; a pair of loving hands patting her to sleep.</p>
<p>It’s shattered by a heart-splitting scream that Mae can hardly hear anymore. The next kick doesn’t connect with her body as something – someone clasps themselves around her, and with the sharp pain that follows she fades with that memory.</p>
<center>**</center>

<p>Max combs the wig smooth. It falls past Mae’s shoulder just to the spot her real hair does when loose. He hands the comb back to Julia and holds up a mirror.</p>
<p>“There. How is it?”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Max sees her crack expression, and smiles himself, too. It’s a small lift of the corners of her lips, her first since she woke up, as though she’s hiding it. Just like he remembers. Landon leans against the wall, arms crossed, and says,</p>
<p>“Nice.”</p>
<p>Julia swipes a stray strand behind Mae’s ear, saying,</p>
<p>“They’ll grow out before long.”</p>
<p>The doctors at the Bennon City Hospital had to shave Mae to stitch the wounds on her head. It was a rather nasty surprise for both her friends and her when they first visited her after she woke up two weeks ago. How did she make it through? Mae has gathered that she didn’t look good at all when they sent her in. Multiple fractured bones and internal bleeding. They had to literally patch her up in a series of surgeries, and even now, most of her body is thick with bandage, as was with her head. She’s tied down by wires and tubes to monitors by her bed; her right arm is in plaster, and even though her left arm isn’t, she has trouble holding anything steady. As for her legs, there is another surgery scheduled for tomorrow, and many more to come after that for other parts of her body.  She can’t do anything, not even cleaning herself. She feels ugly and gross.</p>
<p>“It’s some hell you’ve been through,” Landon says. “You’re tough. I’m glad you are alive, Mae.”</p>
<p>Mae doesn’t reply. Should <em>she</em> be glad? In the past nights, as her fractured memories resurfaced and tried to stitch themselves together, Mae relived that evening again and again in her nightmares. She has become scared of sleeping, staring out of the gap of the window curtains every night until she drifts off, only to jolt awake soon to the beeping of the cardiograph and sometimes the face of the nurse on duty. She dares not ask anyone when she’ll make a full recovery, or if she is able to at all. The future holds no light for her: in the end, she’ll always have to go back to her abysmal home. Sure, her father might be in jail again for this, but he’ll come out at some point. When he does, it’ll just start all over again, and her mother will still not stop him. <em>I haven’t seen her after I woke up, either.</em> Mae thinks. She never knew what it feels like to be angry. She just feels lonely and forsaken, even though her friends are around her bed.</p>
<p>The ward door slides open and her nurse comes with her lunch.</p>
<p>“We can take care of that.” Max receives it with both hands, face red under his black curls. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, thank <em>you</em>.” The nurse replies and says to Mae. “There are more visitors coming up right now, Mae. I think I see your mother.”</p>
<p>“Guess <em>I</em> better take over that. Can’t give Catherine the wrong idea.” Julia winks at Max.</p>
<p>Max returns a shy grin and hands over the tray.</p>
<p>“Say ‘ahhh’, Mae. Mm-hmm.” Landon leans over and peers at Julia cooling a spoonful of porridge down and feeding it to Mae. “Guess that means she’s finally out –”</p>
<p>“Eat up!” Julia coos Mae in an unnecessarily loud voice. She sends spoon after spoon of porridge over, as if to prevent Mae from asking what Landon means.</p>
<p>The ward door is thrown open.</p>
<p>Lily stands in the doorway on crutches, panting with effort. She looks up and around the bright room, and limps in as fast as she can, hopping over the last few meters. Julia and Max retreats just in time as Lily drops her crutches and throws herself onto Mae. Mae draws a sharp breath and winces.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Lily mumbles, balancing on one foot. “I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“I see you got off the wheelchair.” Landon says.</p>
<p>“About time, too.” Lily sits down on the edge of the bed with her back turned to Mae and Julia. She casts a swift glance at Mae’s arm, grabs the plaster and squeezes it.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Mae asks. “Are you alright?” Lily remains silent. Mae looks at the others. “What happened?”</p>
<p>Julia, Landon, and Max look at each other and hesitate. Lily looks at the floor and says nothing. Mae sees a newly-healed scar exposed on the back of her neck under her black ponytail. Outside the door Lily’s mother appear, and behind them, Mae sees the small figure of her own mother, pale and frail. “Lily?” She whispers. “Tell me, please?”</p>
<p>“How are you feeling, dear?” Lily’s mother comes in and kisses Mae.</p>
<p>“What happened to Lily?” Mae asks.</p>
<p>“I fell down! Please!” Lily pleads. Lily and her mother look at each other for a long moment. Mae can’t see her friend’s face but her mother looks conflicted. Catherine walks to a corner and sits down, far from Mae’s bed. Julia, Landon, and Max decide to busy themselves with feeding Mae the rest of her lunch.</p>
<p>“Please don’t take the wrong way, Mae,” Lily’s mother begins. “She just doesn’t want you to blame yourself. Seeing what happened to you that night didn’t sit well with her, either.” Lily pulls her knees to her chin and squeezes her eyes shut. “She covered Richard’s blows for you.”</p>
<p>“Right after we got home, mom got an emergency call from you.” Comes Lily’s muffled voice. Mae blinks. “You were crying for help – the phone recognized that. It was cut off fast. I think your phone broke.”</p>
<p><em>From my fall? Well, that’s that with my phone, then. Less than two weeks of service.</em> Mae thinks.</p>
<p>“I ran over to your house.” Lily breaks off. Her mother lays a hand on her head.</p>
<p>“And that was probably when she saw you and threw herself over you.”</p>
<p>“I was ahead of mom and dad. I think later dad managed to overpower Richard Murray.”</p>
<p>“Lily was just in time.” Her mother finishes. “The last few blows were particularly furious. They fractured her hips and broke her leg. The neighbors apparently called the police. We found the injured man and sent Lily and him to Alvar hospital. Your condition was too severe and you were brought here.”</p>
<p>Mae sees her mother sits in her chair looking at the floor like a statue. This can’t be the first time <em>she</em> hears of the story, can it? The mister from the car and Lily threw themselves in her father’s way, but her mother seems to have done little from the start.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Mae moves her arm to Lily, who grabs onto the plaster again. “I’m –”</p>
<p>“I made a choice.” Lily says thickly into her knee. “So did that man.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing more natural than buying one’s father a present, even if that decision comes with consequences.” Lily’s mother says. “Nobody in here did wrong other than Richard.”</p>
<p>The door slides open for a third time. Lily’s father comes in, his face mirthless - scary, even. He looks around.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s here. How are you, Mae? That’s a pretty wig.” He gives her and her friends a quick smile and says to his wife, “Ryan and Diane did <em>not</em> take the news well. Said I should’ve told them earlier.”</p>
<p>“That can’t be helped. Don’t want them charge in with Mae unconscious.” She says. “And the hearing?”</p>
<p>“Cate needs to make a decision. Right now.” He’s more serious than Mae has ever seen him. “It’s the holidays next week and the court’ll be closed until January. It’ll also be much more difficult once Richard gets inside.” Lily unfurls herself and turns to Catherine, as with her parents. The rest looks as puzzled as Mae is. “I’m sorry to pressure you, but it’s been long enough. You need to make a decision, your god or your daughter and yourself.”</p>
<p>Max is the first to understand, but Julia is the one who dares voicing it.</p>
<p>“Are you going to divorce?”</p>
<p>Mae hears her mother give a shaky gasp, and realizes that she has been weeping all this time, perhaps since she sat down. For the first time Mae is watching her mother cry.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’m not that brave –” Catherine sobs.</p>
<p>“You’re brave enough to consider divorce already. What do you people say?” Lily’s father asks the kids.</p>
<p>“Hell yeah.” Landon says. Julia and Max nod in agreement.</p>
<p>“Besides, you gave Mae almost half of your blood as well as your bone marrow without even hesitating. If that’s not brave I don’t know what is.” He crosses his arms. Mae finally understands why her mother looks so pale. He turns to her, “Yeah, she’s just out of hospital herself. You’ve lost too much blood, sweet.”</p>
<p>Lily’s mother walks over and crouches before Catherine’s hunched figure. She places a hand on her arm.</p>
<p>“Cate, you have already made the decision, didn’t you? You just need to summon that courage and say it.”</p>
<p>“What if he comes for revenge?”</p>
<p>“We’ll be there.”</p>
<p>Catherine sniffs and nods.</p>
<p>“I will press it.”</p>
<p>Lily’s mother breaks into a smile of relief and Lily’s father whistles.</p>
<p>“Great! We’ll go sign it in the afternoon, then. Makes the scolding from Mae’s grandparents much easier to bear. Now what’s up with my girl?” Lily’s father grins.</p>
<p>“She fell asleep.” Mae says.</p>
<p>“That was fast. She can finally sleep well, I think. Been having nightmares about you every night. It really wasn’t a pretty sight…” He picks up Lily’s crutches and leans them against the bed, and crouches down to level his eyes with Mae’s. His hitherto hard expression softens. “You’re tough, Mae. Not sure about you, but I’m glad you’re alive.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I said.” Landon stretches. “See, that’s what everyone says.”</p>
<p>“Go figure.” Lily’s father gives Landon a fist bump across the bed. “Anyone want lunch? Come on, kids. Iris? Cate?”</p>
<p>“You go.” Catherine says to Lily’s mother, who nods and stands up. They left.</p>
<p>Outside the window is the drifting snow. Inside the ward is equally silent. Mae avoids looking at her mother, and stares at Lily hunched at the edge of her bed, sleeping, instead. <em>How can she even hold up the posture for so long?</em> As soon as she finishes the thought, Lily sways and falls sideways onto the bed, and sleeps on. Mae peers at her neck. The scar she saw earlier was just one of many. She had stitches, too.</p>
<p>It’s because of her and that mister from the car that she’s alive. And perhaps her mother. Yes, her mother. It seems that everything will end well for them, at least. Yet Mae can’t help but feel there’s one piece missing.</p>
<p>Catherine moves her chair next to Mae’s bed with an effort, breaking her thoughts, and sits staring at Mae’s wrist. <em>Hm?</em> Mae looks at her.</p>
<p>“Richard’s in custody. I should let you know.” Catherine starts, voice thick. “The man that tried to help you was a police officer off-duty. I don’t know how that’ll be taken into account.”</p>
<p>“Right.” Mae manages to say. <em>No, this isn’t it…</em></p>
<p>“Will you forgive me?” Catherine starts again, almost timid. “For being a bad mother?” Mae looks up and meeting her mother’s big eyes. She looks like she has been through a lot in the past month, too. It’s rare to find anything in her eyes, usually, other than terror. “I was always too scared to stop him. Will you forgive me?”</p>
<p><em>I don’t know. And this isn’t what’s missing, either.</em> Mae thinks. She asks instead, “Were you scared? During the bone marrow transplant?”</p>
<p>“It was the least she can do,” comes Lily’s drowsily voice. Mae jumps. When did she wake up? “You need to earn her forgiveness.” She flips around, legs dangling over the side of the bed, looking groggily at Catherine.</p>
<p>Lily is known for her directness that borders harshness, but Mae is still surprised that she takes it to an adult. She’s even more surprised by her mother dipping her head in earnest and obedience. Lily sighs and flings an arm over Mae’s body. Mae winces, and Lily falls asleep again.</p>
<p>“Mom. There’s something in my bag that’s wrapped in blue paper.” Mae mumbles. “It’s for you. I hope it didn’t break when I dropped it.”</p>
<p>“We’ll open it together when you are home. For now –” She hesitates.</p>
<p>It’s long overdue, the kiss that her mother plants on her forehead. </p>
<p><em>There.</em></p>
