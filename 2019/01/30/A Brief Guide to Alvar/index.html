        <h2 id="general-introduction">General Introduction</h2>
<p>The town of Alvar is located in Noble County in the U.S. state of Ohio, 360 kilometers west of the Appalachian Mountains in the North American continent and 120 kilometers south of the Lake Erie. The closest city, Bennon, is 20 kilometers to the north. Alvar is a municipal town governed by a town council, and its population was 427 at the 2020 census.</p>

<h2 id="geography-and-town-layout">Geography and Town Layout</h2>
<img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Map2.jpg" class="" title="Location of Alvar">
<img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Map.jpg" class="" title="Alvar Street Map">
<p>Alvar has a total area of 1.8 square kilometers, with its land measuring 1.6 square kilometers and its waters (Alvar Pond) measuring 0.2 square kilometers. The town is situated on the northern slope of Alvar Hill and measures 1 kilometer from north to south and 1.6 kilometers east to west. Its Main Street starts from 1 kilometer north of the northern town edge and ends at the southern edge of the town, where the forest covering the Alvar Hill begins and also where the slope becomes steeper. Alvar Hill has a height of 86 meters and an altitude of 200 meters. Lying at its foot in the south is Alvar Pond with an average depth of 20 meters. The pond contains mostly trout. The island at its center measures 16,000 square meters. The forest on Alvar Hill consists a mixture of pine and deciduous trees. It spans a further kilometer south of the hill, surrounding the pond and providing a hunting ground of 300 acres. However, the forest south of Alvar Hill does not fall under Alvar's management.</p>
<p>In Alvar, the words "street" and "road" carry specific meanings when referred to the layout of the town. "Streets" run only in the north-south direction and are straight. The "roads" run in the east-west direction and are usually curved or even serpentine depending on the geography of the hill. The Main Street and the Avenue Road are the central street and road, respectively. Main Street divides Alvar into its East and West districts. Other streets are named by the district they are located in, followed by their distance from the Main Street, eg. East 1st Street, West 9th Street, etc. The roads in Alvar are named in series, such as "the Seasons" (Spring Road, Summer Road, Autumn Road, and Winter Road) and "the Gardens" (Rose Road, Shamrock Road, Orchid Road, and Lily Road). Because of the gradual slope, each road is higher than the one north of it. Roads and streets in Alvar tend to be narrow, only wide enough for two cars to pass through side by side. The sidewalks are 1 meter wide with no public lawns, and some streets and roads do not have sidewalks. All trees and lawns are in the household gardens.</p>
<h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>
<p>As of 2020 census, Alvar had a population of 427, 156 households, and 129 families. The population density was 267 people per square kilometer. The racial makeup of the town was 79.1% White, 1.0% African American, 1.3% Hispanic or Latinx, 9.1% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 8.7% from two or more races, and 0.08% from other races. 98.0% of the White populations were of Irish descent.</p>
<p>The median age in Alvar was 56. 8.0% of residents were under the age of 18; 11.7% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 15.7% were between 25 and 44; 30.1% were from 45 to 64; 34.5% were over the age of 65. The gender ratio of male to female was 636:655, 48.9% male and 51.1% female.</p>
<p>A total of 107 crimes were documented from 2011 to 2020, of which 93 were physical assaults in the form of bar brawl; 19 were domestic violence, and 7 were motor vehicle theft.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The area surrounding Alvar Hills was used as part of the hunting grounds for Shawnee Indians until the arrival of 17 Scotch-Irish immigrants led by Aulon Weir in the spring of 1744. Weir allegedly purchased Alvar Hill and its surrounding areas with "a year's supply of brandy and four barrels of gunpowder along with twenty muskets." Academics held a skeptical view toward this account for a long time: in 2008, local historian Beatrice McNeal unearthed a Shawnee settlement site a mile west of Alvar, along with 34 charred bodies of various ages dating back to 1700s. The remain of a male body of Irish origin in the center of the explosion suggested that "Alvar was built on lies and blood," as Dr. McNeal wrote later. The diary of Aulon Weir's wife, Moira Weir, which was also rediscovered in the Alvar Library in 2008, helped historians confirm Dr. McNeal's speculation.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted today that Weir and his company crossed the Appalachian Mountains on March 4, 1744, and settled at the foot of Alvar Hill on on March 11. On March 21, Shawnees returned to the village west of Alvar Hill and hunters discovered Weir's settlement. The peaceful negotiation for the ownership of the territory lasted for a week and a payment of a year's supply of brandy and 20 muskets was settled upon for the land up to "a thousand yard [0.944 km] north from the foot of the Hill, totaling 200 acres [0.81 sq km]." The exchange was peacefully made on March 28. On April 3, 1744, Weir wished to make an additional purchase for the hill and the pond at its south. The Shawnee requested four barrels of gunpowder as payment, but only for the right of use. Weir bartered 8 barrels for the ownership, but was rejected. On April 5, 1744, Finnegan Weir, brother of Aulon Weir, entered the Shawnee village to accept the price for usage rights. As the entire village gathered as witnesses, Finnegan Weir revealed his real intent. He pulled out his pair of reading glass before he read the contract, but instead of putting them on, he focused sunlight through them onto the open barrels of gunpowder. Aulon Weir led 5 men after the explosion into the burning village and shot the survivors and the wounded.</p>
<p>In 1784, Alvar, along with the Ohio Country, became part of the Northwest Territory according to the Treaty of Paris. In 1803, Alvar came under the governance of the newly accepted State of Ohio as part of Washington County, and later became part of Noble County at its establishment in 1851, keeping its municipality and its designation as a "town" (as opposed to the "village" defined in the Ohio Constitution) as part of negotiation by Brendan Weir, the Chair of the Town Council of Alvar and son of Aulon Weir.</p>
<p>By the 1900s Alvar was well-known as a slow-paced Irish residential town and largely overlooked by outsiders. It wasn't until the rise of Bennon as a center of education and culture before Alvar came into the public's (however slight) attention. Due to its proximity to the city and the University of Ohio, Bennon Campus, and its cheap housing rates, a handful of working people moved into the town since 1918. Because of its reputation as an all-Irish settlement, only three African American and five Native American residents were recorded in the 1980 census. With the expansion of the Bennon campus in 1963, Alvar enjoyed a further in-rush of residents with a noticeable increase of people of color.</p>
<p>On July 4, 1989, a two-people brawl outside the town's tavern, Shamrock and Eagle, escalated into a six-people shooting gunfight involving three African American college students and three locals of Irish descent. Four were shot dead, and one was heavily wounded and died later in the emergency room. The only survivor, McCoy Lowry, claimed that the initial argument started with his friend Connor Kelleher challenging an African American student's claims of "American identity". The 1989 Alvar Tavern Shooting reduced its African American and Native American population by 80%; it has been on the rise again from 2001, and stabilized in 2017. The Asian population also increased slightly, as other villages around Bennon had deeper histories with Asian communities.</p>
<p>In 2018, <em>Forbes</em> noted that Alvar had the lowest crime rate in the country. A state-wide survey in 2020 found that Alvar had the highest average age in Ohio. Another survey also found that Alvar is popularly known as "that tucked-away village" by the 3% of the Ohio population that were aware of its existence.</p>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<h3 id="government">Government</h3>
<p>Alvar is governed via a Town Council. The council consists of seven members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chair of the Council</li>
<li>Chair of Business and Finance
<ul>
<li>Regulation of business ownership and the treasurer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chair of Communications and Public Relations
<ul>
<li>public relationship with other villages, cities, etc. and oversees media</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chair of Development
<ul>
<li>oversees town development and environmental concerns</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chair of Education and Entertainment
<ul>
<li>in charge of kindergarten and elementary school concerns in Alvar as well as event planning for holidays and festivals</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chair of Jurisdictions (The Grand Judge)
<ul>
<li>oversees the court and town's rules and regulations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chair of Public Health and Safety
<ul>
<li>clinics, hospital, and home safety, also the Alvar police force and fire department</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Theoretically all seven council members are of equal importance. In practice Chair of the Council is akin to the mayor and more often than not serves as the public spokesperson; Chair of Communications and Public Relations became more or less a minor role in the council in "public relations". In recent years, however, the Chair of Communications and Public Relations has been making more appearances in public and engaging with nearby villages and city of Bennon officials, promoting more exposure for Alvar.</p>
<p>All council members are elected to a five-year term by the entire town; only current residents with four or more years of continuous residency in Alvar are eligible to run and be elected for a council position, and only current residents with six or more months of continuous residency in Alvar are allowed to vote.</p>
<p>While the council makes administrative and legislative decisions of the town, the Committee serves as the bridge between the town residents and the council. It consists of 8 members, each representing two "sectors" (the strip of blocks within two adjacent streets) during committee meetings. Due to the importance and the length of the Main Street, the representation of sectors between East 1st Street and West 1st Street is an exception, as they are represented by two committee members.</p>
<p>Committee members communicate with residents and business-owners of their respective sectors, passing along important policy drafts and open voting sessions to each block from the council, and issues raised by residents to the council. Committee members are nominated by the residents of the sectors, and are voted upon every two years by both the council and the residents from the sector, who have over three months' of Alvar residency.</p>
<p>All members of the council and the Committee are subjected to the "Antidic Rule" ("anti"-"dictation"), which states that, as a collective, Alvar residents have the power to sack immediately any council or Committee member involved in, but not limited to, crime, dictatorship, ill management, or poor health, as long as the threshold of petition is met or exceeded. For council members, the threshold is 45% of the entire Alvar population, regardless of term of residency; for Committee members, the threshold is 25% of the population in the sector represented by the member in question. The "Antidic Rule" was established after the sacking of Aulon Weir and has not invoked since.</p>
<p>All voting requires proof of legal status in the United States and a minimum age of 14. All positions in the council and the Committee require proof of legal citizenship or permanent residency in the United States, as well as an age of 30 or above.</p>
<p>Council meetings are held weekly, and the last meeting of every month is open to public in the meeting hall in the Town Hall. Committee meetings with the council are held bi-weekly, and are open to public at all times in the Courthouse.</p>
<p>Though Alvar has high municipality, the State of Ohio withholds the ultimate right of governance.</p>
<h3 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h3>
<p>Alvarians enjoy a slow-paced and relaxed lifestyle.</p>
<p>On weekdays, Alvarians commute to work in Bennon mostly by light rail that runs every 15 minutes. Cars, while used, are uncommon because of the lack of easy-to-travel by-roads onto the highway. In the evening, the townspeople either stay at home or visit the local tavern, Shamrock and Eagle. Bedtime is generally 10 p.m. On weekends, Alvarians are accustomed to sleeping in, starting their day after 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Local business hours run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekends. Due the nature of their business, breakfast cafés run from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. daily, the tavern opens from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. from Sunday to Thursday and 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. on weekends, and the tavern-affiliated inn opens from 7 a.m. to midnight, but has personnel at the front desk 24/7.</p>
<p>Though the Alvarians live up to the hot-tempered (and drunk) Irish stereotype, they are generally open, hospitable, and eager to help. It is an unwritten rule to provide shelter to travelers at night when requested. This is not without precaution, however: everyone is trained in self-defense martial arts from elementary school to middle school since 1939. Residents from outside are also required to participate in a month-long self-defense program when they settle in. In more recent times, travelers to the town are required to present a valid ID that is to be recorded by police night patrols before being taken in. However, this has been rare with the expansion of the town's inn in 2001.</p>
<p>Alvarians enjoy gardening and outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and hunting. The forest south of Alvar Hill is a popular hunting spot for the townspeople, and Alvar Pond is likewise for trout-fishing. Children in Alvar engage in the parkour tradition from the age of five.</p>
<h3 id="landmarks">Landmarks</h3>
<h4 id="the-olde-square">The Olde Square</h4>
<p>The Olde Square is located at the east end of Avenue Road. Three buildings enclose the 2025 square meters of granite-paved clearing: on the south side is the Courthouse; at the east end is the Town Hall; bordering the north side is the Town Archives and Library, which was also the old Alvar church. Although the square and its buildings have undergone three major renovations and restorations in 1844, 1950, and 2011, they retained their rustic and simple style. The 1844 renovation witnessed the fall of Aulon Weir's statue, and the erection of a sundial in its place. In 1950, the Olde Square's buildings, along with the rest of Alvar, embraced electricity. This brought about the total renovation of the buildings on the Olde Square to their current looks. The wooden structures were mostly replaced by blocks of granite, the Town Hall was expanded eastwards and a story upwards (totaling two), and the Alvar Church was re-purposed into a full library and archives. Today only the entrance way of the Town Hall remains in its original 1744 wooden construction, together with its thatched roof that is replaced every decade.</p>
<h4 id="the-hospital-of-alvar">The Hospital of Alvar</h4>
<p>The Hospital of Alvar complex takes up the entire block bordered by four streets and roads; in the clockwise direction, they are: West 2nd Street, Autumn Road, West 1st Street, and Spring Road. The precursor of the complex was the town clinic of Alvar. Built in 1746, the log cabin was renovated into a stone cabin in 1790, and was further expanded in 1840 to accommodate runaway slaves who wandered off the usual Underground Railroad routes. The clinic was later incorporated as a station for slaves en route to Sandusky or Cleveland, and was frequented because of its rather isolated location and the fierceness of the locals against slave catchers. The clinic grew in size during this time as a station and became the Hospital of Alvar in 1856. By the end of the Civil War, the Hospital of Alvar had assisted a total of 534 slaves on their bid for freedom.</p>
<p>Today the original clinic still stands and opens to Spring Road. It serves both as an urgent care in its east wing and a memorial museum of Alvar's only involvement in the Civil War in its west wing.</p>
<h4 id="the-observatory-tower">The Observatory Tower</h4>
<img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Observatory.jpg" class="" title="The Alvar Observatory">
<p>The most prominent structure in Alvar, both in terms of its physical appearance and its mystery, is the observatory tower. Standing 15 meters atop Alvar Hill and measuring 10 meters in diameter, the cylindrical marble tower is wrapped with ivies on the exterior wall and capped by a matte silver metallic dome. The base of the dome is covered by a band of sapphire a meter in width and 30 centimeters in thickness.</p>
<p>Little about the observatory's origin can be found in the town records. The earliest mention of the observatory comes from Aulon Weir. On March 30, 1744, Weir wrote in his diary,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tower! Such a Structure on the Hill, Walls crawling with dried-up Ivies all around and cracking here and there. Its Windows were the clearest I have ever seen---Finn banged his Head on it when he tried to poke it in and have a Look around. It did not even crack; I swear by God that Finn has the thickest and hardest Head around, and the Ivies shook when he made Contact. Nay, not a hairline Crack. Through the Windows we saw Shelves, all empty. There seemed to be a Statue in there, but the inside was not well-lit despite the windows; we could only see halfway in. Facing the North is a set of Steps leading up to a Gate of black Metal. We saw no Keys nor Keyholes nor any other Mechanisms to open it. Took my trusty Pickaxe to it and bloody Hell, nearly broke my Arms and definitely my Pick. It crumbled against the Gate. Asked the Indians about the Tower. Got their usual Fudge about Gods walking the Earth and peering into the Heavens to return Home. PISH!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April 1, 1744, Weir wrote again in his diary of the observatory, though briefly,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some bloody fucking Joke this is. Got a Mallet out of Granite made from the Smithy, and mulled the Window of that blasted Tower. The Mallet <strong><em>shattered</em></strong>. Took the Musket right up against it, and the Barrel exploded like somebody stuffed it. I be the Fool the day I decided to go in. Finn was still obsessed. Fucking Blockhead, should not have listened to him in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Alvarian fascination with the observatory lasted only until Aulon Weir's death in 1783. The mysterious observatory was ignored and avoided for the best part of 120 years until, in 1910, a small group of four historians led by René Luce took an interest in the tower. However, without a way to enter the structure, Luce was only able to record measurements of the exterior and photograph through the windows.</p>
<p>Luce's group was closely related to the Alvarian myth that the observatory tower was cursed. On August 13, 1910, the owner of the local inn and tavern, Shamrock and Eagle, found that Luce and his group had disappeared overnight. All of their luggage were left behind except for the black Oxford briefcase Luce always carried around. Nobody reported seeing them leave, and a combing through their belongings by the police found a curious absence of materials related to the observatory. The rumor that the group was "cursed and spirited away" because of their involvement with the observatory tower started spreading and prevailed up to this day, even though it was personally debunked by René Luce and the publication of his 1912 paper on the observatory, <em>La tour curieuse du passé: sur l'Observatoire d'Alvar</em>. Luce's own account of the "disappearance" was simple. His group was on their last round of photography excursion at the observatory on the night of August 12 when the American photographer Thomas Brown emerged from the woods south of the observatory, and they struck up a conversation. Eventually Brown became intrigued by Luce's group's camera. Brown helped Luce and his group take photographs of the observatory, and the latter followed Brown further south to investigate "an Indian ruin [Brown] passed on the way here". It became the beginning of another investigation of an unknown "trail of tears". Luce's group never had an opportunity to return to Alvar for their belongings due to the intensity of their investigation before they had to return to France. "It was lucky that we had our passports and wallets on us at all times when we go on international excursions." Luce later commented. "We later had our stuff shipped back to us. Cost a fortune, but nothing's lost."</p>
<p>The myth kept people away from the observatory until 2003, when the Alvar-born historian Beatrice McNeal led her team of two historians, one mathematician, one engineer, and one linguist to study the observatory for her doctoral dissertation. McNeal gained entrance of the observatory by reverse-engineering the black gate using ultrasonic and X-ray equipment. The engineer, Buck Hoffmann, disabled the locking mechanism with electromagnetic methods and fixed a mechanical lock and door handle to the gate for future entries. Through radiocarbon dating of the wooden furniture, McNeal estimated the age of the observatory to be 4,000 years old. In 2013 McNeal further assessed the observatory's age with luminescence dating. She concluded an age of 4,200 years in her 2014 paper.</p>
<img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Observatory%20rendered.jpg" class="" title="Model of Alvar Observatory as rendered by Dr. Beatrice McNeal">
<p>McNeal described the observatory to have three floors: the subfloor, the atrium, and the observatory dome.</p>
<p>The subfloor is a round library hall measuring 24 meters in diameter and 5 meters in height. It houses 230 redwood bookcases, each with five 40-centimeter tall shelves. It is unknown how the trees or the shelves were transported to the site. The bookcases measure 1.2 meters wide and 30 centimeters deep. Two hundreds of them are arranged into four square sections, five in each row. Two two-meter wide aisle perpendicular to each other separate the four sections. The rest 30 bookcases are lined around the wall with redwood desks and chairs. Two rows of lamp run along the wall at the height of 1.5 meters and 3 meters off the floor, respectively. At the center, where the two aisles cross each other, is an intriguing machine on a three-tiered marble base. The machine resembles a modern computer case attached to a dentist's chair and a lectern. The casing of the processor tower is made of matte black metal. X-ray failed to penetrate its thick shell. Above the chair is an obsidian half-dome, reaching down from a thick, matte casing that extended from the back of the chair. The lectern is placed under a rod. There is neither an apparent booting method nor any signs of a power source. Directly above the machine is an orb around 1 meter in diameter hanging down from the ceiling, held in place by three interlinked chains. The orb seems to be made of smoky crystal, and disperses light around the subfloor when shone upon. On the wall to the south is another black gate. The gate is arched at the top, measuring two meters wide and three meters tall. Patterns are engraved on its surface, originating from a ring pattern 2 meters above the floor, splitting into two main paths, branching and curving their ways downward into the ground. Dr. McNeal failed to reverse engineer the gate, as it is impregnable by X-ray or ultrasound.</p>
<p>The atrium on the first floor is dim despite the tall and wide windows along the wall. Each window sits 50 centimeters above the ground, towering 3 meters high and ranging from 2 meters to 4 meters wide. Once unlatched, the windows can be either pushed open or slid into the gaps between the double-layered tower wall. When pushed open, the window panes can refract light into the interior and brighten up the room considerably. The exterior and the interior wall layers are 70 centimeters and 20 centimeters thick, respectively. X-ray analysis revealed a curious structural design in the ten-centimeter gap between the exterior and interior walls: slabs of additional marble are placed in the gaps to form intersecting channels throughout. Dr. McNeal speculates that these structures served as pipes that are absent: had the observatory a heating or a cooling system, the air or water could move through the wall for high regulation efficiency.</p>
<p>The first floor also contains bookshelves, lamps, and desks like the subfloor library. The statue in the center that was observed in Weir's diary is pristine and accumulated no dust to date. It is intricately sculpted out of white marble, depicting a long-haired young king with sharp features and rather pointed ears hidden beneath the sculpted hair. Its eyes are set with sapphire. The writing on the base it stands on bears a plaque, and the writing upon is fiery and indecipherable. A map of parchment, 2 meters by 2 meters, hangs on the southeast section of the wall near the stairs up. It is annotated in the fiery writing as well as showing unfamiliar landscapes. Scholars debated its authenticity, some comparing it to the <em>Voynich Manuscript</em> while others claimed it merely shows an older landscape of the local area, pointing to a section recognized by many as the Alvar Pond, citing its larger area, its different southern shoreline, and the depiction of a river that now runs underground.</p>
<p>The second floor is the observatory dome, 10 meters in height from the floor to the apex of the silver dome. On the west section of the wall is a set of steps leading to a platform 2.5 meters wide and 2 meters above the floor. Below it are four more bookcases. The platform runs for 3 meters along the wall, its edge marked with crystal panels set in rails. At its end are more curious machines with metal casings like the one in the subfloor library, but these have smaller processing cases. Columns raising from the processing cases support several sloped control panels with buttons, switches, and levers presumably to control the telescope. An obsidian slab is raised behind the control panels as though a screen. Again, as with the machine in the subfloor library, the control apparatus cannot be activated or scanned for interior design.</p>
<p>The telescope in the center of the room is supported by a mobile, circular base. The base has six granite wheels around its circumference, all one-meter in diameter, double-layered, and 25 centimeters thick per layer, a total of 60 centimeters thick. The wheels run in 62-centimeter wide grooves in the floor, presumably in both directions to rotate the telescope. The base of the telescope has a diameter of 3 meters. The lens of the telescope is 5 meters long with a pitching angle from 20° to 70°. The eyepiece is 10 centimeters in diameter and the objective is 1.2 meters. X-ray unraveled a complex diffraction and reflection mechanism within the lens, which provides a calculated focal length of 20 meters. Another black metal box was discovered in the column supporting the lens with filaments resembling wires connecting it to the objective lens. Combined with hairline filaments crisscrossing the objective lens, it is speculated that the telescope is able to perform imaging through mechanisms other than mere optical imaging.</p>
<p>A set of steps on the east side of the base lead up to the stone seat in front of the eyepiece. A small obsidian slab raises up and forward from the right armrest of the seat. The slab's position is adjustable.</p>
<p>There are also 12 granite wheels along the base of the dome. These wheels run on track rails, and are also double-layered, but with a longer axle compared to the wheels of the telescope. Each axle connects the outer double wheel and the inner double wheel. The bottom of the dome has grooves for the axles to settle in. The sapphire band outside bends backward at its top and fits into the gap between the layers of the outer wheel, locking itself securely with the dome and alleviates the mechanical stress the band might be under; with the protruding tracks the outer wheel runs on, the sapphire band also locks the wheels into place, which secures, in turn, the dome. The wheels can rotate the dome in both directions.</p>
<p>The wall of the second floor bears 9 smaller windows, 1.5 meters tall and 1 meter wide, making the hall even more dim than the floor below. However, all of these windows can be moved like those in the atrium, and bring in light from outside to great effect. Additionally, several movable slabs of metal on the dome seem to serve as windows when more daylight is needed. These can be pushed open quite easily, as long as one is able to reach them; however, situated at least 7 meters off the ground, it will be no small task. A larger slab of metal that acts as the skylight for the telescope is also on the dome. No powered mechanisms of control of any kind was found. Historians and researchers have not succeeded in operating the telescope, or any part of the observatory, except for the front gate.</p>
<p>In addition to the power source, despite the total 240 bookcases found in the tower, not a single scroll, tome, book, or text collections or information containers of any known kind was found other than the plaque on the statue and the map. The materials found so far are insufficient to reveal concrete information of the observatory's origin. Due to its unique design and lack of reliable historical records, no realistic theory is proposed publicly on the subject. Dr. McNeal, the historian most involved in the research of the observatory, commented,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The joke within our circle, of course, is that the tower was built aliens stranded on Earth to find a way home. Believe or not, this joke is more readily accepted than the theory saying it's a practical joke by the Weir Family. Looking at the aesthetic style of the tower, the outlandish design of the mechanisms of the door and the telescope, the advanced and, seriously, <em>alien</em> technology, ya' know, involved in the entire building process, and the fact that the tower has no power source found yet everything within demands a power source to function---oh not to mention that Indian myth Weir reported in his diary---it is too hard <em>not</em> to think of extra-terrestrials, ya' know? Oh, have I mentioned that my linguist friend on my team told us that the language system on the map and the plaque is <em>nothing</em> like any language we have on Earth, be it natural or artificial? But it bares unmistakable signs of a natural language, ya' know? Of course, no---I'm more inclined to the theory that a more technologically advanced ancient civilization built this. <em>That</em> is probably the most logical answer here. Too bad I'm not allowed to dig under my town for more, ya' know? Too bad there are talks in the council about razing this thing down for a highway by-road. They've want a proper road to Highway 77 for ages, ya' know, more convenient access to Bennon. Of course I could just throw the ancient civ theory out at them, but if <em>you</em> are the decision-makers, would <em>you</em> buy it?"</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>The first Alvarian houses were log cabins with traditional Irish thatched roof because of a lack of stone resource in the area. Later the entire town of Alvar underwent two large-scale renovations: one in 1844, shortly after the installment of the first steam-powered railway system; another in 1950, with the introduction of affordable electricity.</p>
<p>The 1844 renovation was a facelift for Alvar. The newly built train station and the railway connected Alvar with the then-growing village of Bennon, providing more robust commercial trade with the outside world. The railway also brought in aesthetics and practices prevalent of the time. Soon the modernization began, first with architecture. Stone blocks for construction were imported for the first time, through the railway. The traditional sharp-angled thatched roof and hemp-tied log cabins were replaced by the more fireproof, tiled roofs and stone walls. The fire pits in the center of each log cabin evolved into stone fireplaces in the back of the living room. The dirt roads became paved. The town was also able to expand and established the convention of "streets" and "roads".</p>
<p>The 1950 renovation brought Alvar more up-to-date systems, such as electricity, tap water system, proper drainage, town-wide heating system, and updates to the architecture that remain to this day. All new systems run underground, including electricity and telephone cables, and the later optical fibers.</p>
<p>Houses in Alvar today are built of stone bricks and are painted gray, white, or yellow. The houses are traditionally low, with no elevated front porches, and no more than two stories high. The first story is dug into the ground; upon entering the front door, there will always be two steps down. The houses have basements but no attics. Each house has either one or two chimneys. Since 1950, the roofs are covered in thicker black or red tiles than the ones used in 1844, and are striated with ridges that can guide rainwater to either side. The slope of the roofs also became much more flat in the 1950 renovation, angling between 15° to 20° downward. Roofs cover not only the second story but also the protruding first story in the front and back, as well as the side without a chimney, giving the houses a tiered appearance. The lower roofs generally extends 1 meter from the wall, and the upper roofs are much shorter, usually 15 to 20 centimeters. Gardens are surrounded with low walls 1 meter tall and 30 centimeters wide, leaving a gap for the entrance way. The size of the houses and the gardens vary from household to household, but because of the road layout, the backyards are generally a less-than-one-meter wide strip half covered by the lower roof.</p>
<p>One unique structure of Alvarian architecture that can be seen frequently in the town is the roof bridges. First conceived during the 1844 renovation and became more and more widely accepted after 1950, the roof bridges connect the second stories of the two houses on the opposite sides of a street of a road. These bridges are 2 meters wide and are supported by a long arch. Roofs of both houses extend to cover the bridge. In the case which the two roofs are not in the same color, usually the tile color of the bridge is a mix of the two depending on the two households.</p>
<p>The roof bridges were intended as emergency escape routes. At either end of the bridge is a fireproof door that the house owners have keys to. The corridor has two windows on either side of the wall, and a trapdoor in the ceiling in the middle of the bridge. Each roof bridge is equipped with heavy-duty rope ladders under the low interior windowsills, in addition to fire extinguishers, bulletproof vests, tear spray, and emergency hammers. In emergencies residents can escape through windows onto the ground or the trapdoor onto the roof if needed. All roof bridges and their equipment are checked twice every year by the fire department.</p>
<p>Roof bridges are considered a defining symbol of Alvar. There are 70 roof bridges in total, and most of them are within East and West 3rd Streets, but a handful of them can also be seen in the more recent expansions of the town outside the two streets.</p>
<h3 id="parkour">Parkour</h3>
<p>Visitors of Alvar, be it tourists or hunters seeking a quiet fishing or hunting spot in fall, or hikers emerging from the trails in the Alvar Woods, or students of the University attracted by low rents, never fail to be astonished by the sight of children sprinting and leaping on top of the houses when they first arrive in Alvar. If they asked a child where he or she hang out in free time, the answer would always be, "the roof tops!" as it has been for the past eight decades. Thus is the one-of-a-kind underage parkour culture in Alvar, thanks to the town's landscape and layout.</p>
<p>Unlike the world outside, parkour activities are limited only to children in Alvar. What is more, the activity is sanctioned, and even encouraged. Children of Alvar are characteristically agile, and start parkour as early as at the age of five. Young children learn the activity through older children. The first steps begin with climbing onto the low garden walls and learning how to balance, and followed by running and skipping on the lower roofs. At the age of six the children can climb onto the lower roofs by leaping from the side or the back garden wall. An average eight-year-old Alvarian child is able to freerun around the roofs in his or her block and, with the help of roof bridges, perhaps those in the neighboring blocks. A ten-year-old can freerun throughout the town.</p>
<p>The usual route of parkour starts with scaling up to the lower roof either by leaping and grabbing from the side or the back garden wall or from the second-floor windows. From here, the lower roofs provide a runway along the road (interspersed with garden walls and trees). The upper roofs are reached only by scaling the walls. From the upper roof, the child can reach the lower roof of the adjacent house south by jumping down; ambitious children are able to do so via the lower roofs as well, thanks to the close height difference and the gap between the two lower roofs. Because of the distance and height, roads and streets are crossed only via the roof bridges, or at the end of the roads where roofs are closer together. Very rarely a child can be seen to cross via strong trees. This stunt often ends in a trip to the urgent care.</p>
<p>It is unclear how the culture started or why it is pertained to children. The first evidence of this activity was from a travel log in the early 1950s, and scholars believed that the sturdier structures and the ridged tiles brought about by the 1950 renovation paved the way for the beginning of this tradition. Anthropologist Trevor Murphy, an Alvar local himself, agrees to this view and points out that photographs of Alvar by Thomas Brown, who returned to Alvar multiple times in his life up to his death in 1968, provide indirect support. In photographs from 1946, the roof tops are still bare. In a photograph from 1954, however, a group of young men and women above twenty can be seen leaning against a chimney while two children run across a roof bridge. Brown was known to be particularly fond of the photograph of a young woman leaping over a gap to the roof he was standing on, taken from the same period. Murphy also found mentions of parkour activity in diaries of grownups at the time. These mentions, however, ceased after 1960. A later collaboration paper between McNeal and Murphy in 2011 contained an economical explanation to this phenomenon. The roofs can support a combined weight of no more than three adults before the tiles break. This means that prolonged running and leaping activities from adults will wear down the tiles faster, causing a sizable amount of repair cost. Children, on the other hand, will cause much less damage because of their size, especially when taken into account that children of Alvar are rarely overweight because of their lifestyle. Indeed, in 1959, the year of the state-wide flood in Ohio, repair cost for the roofs dropped by 85%, merely because the majority of the adult population in Alvar spent an entire year joining the post-flood reconstruction efforts in the nearby village, Howard, and did not engage in parkour activities. The continuously low roof repair costs seems to indicate that the adults dropped the activity since then. Murphy further commented in the paper,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From my own personal experiences, most of the children parkoured less and less at the age of 15. It is no coincidence, I think, that this is also the age at which they prepare for high schools. Alvar itself no longer has a local high school, and children have to attend out of town. A lot of their choices are boarding schools as well, and some children, like I was, come home only once a month. This, together with the increased schoolwork, cut down the time they can parkour. As their teenage bodies mature, they realize themselves as well that if they continue to parkour, they will not only be putting their safety at risk, but also that of the roofs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the concerns of safety, both McNeal and Murphy suggest that it is minor. In their survey for the 2011 paper, 96% of adults local to Alvar (both born in the town and residents of over five years) reported that they would worry more if their children does <em>not</em> join in the parkour culture. Top concerns for this include potential health issues (the child might have ailments preventing him or her from freerunning or he or she might not get enough exercise) and bullying behavior (the child might be bullied by others or he or she might be unpopular). This, however, does not mean safety is not on the minds of the parents, as their paper stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The initiation to the activity is always done by the parents. A common exchange between young children around five is, "did your ma/pa put you on the wall yet?" The phrase "put on the wall" means the initiation, in which the parent puts the child onto the garden wall, letting the child walk along while holding his or her hands, and helping the child find the way down. During the first weeks, the parents will repeatedly recite safety rules to the child before he or she gets on the wall: "Always watch your steps; never parkour after sundown; never make a jump without complete confidence; never jump down from upper roofs; never run over streets or roads when cars are driving past; never run across the Main Street; never cross streets or roads from trees." Peer supervision also adds another layer of safety. Children stopping each other from dangerous stunts are uncommon but also not rare. The town also imposes a ban on parkour after 5 p.m. all year long. Police night patrol will be out at this time, and will ask children to get down. To our knowledge there is yet to be a case of disobedience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Occasionally deaths and injuries will occur. There is a total of 22 injuries and one death from 2010 to 2020.</p>
