<p><em>Beware when alone inside, lest the Phantoms lure you astray.</em> This is what they always say about the Forest. Every year people both local and foreign enter under its twilight canopy. Many walk out unscathed; a few are never found again; some come back, and tell the strangest stories, possible only in dreams, luring, almost like the Phantoms, more people inside.</p>
<p>Rich games, flourishing plants, scattering ruins---these the Forest held within its bosom along with who knows what other secrets, hiding and protecting them like a mother.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>As our mother drove through the tollgate, my little sister tugged me and whispered if we'd really be alright staying here. I whispered back that we would, hoping to sooth her---and myself. Counting in the other two families, we had eleven people, not one. The Forest conjured Phantoms according to a person's desires, they said, but if we stayed together it wouldn't know whose mind to base upon... Right? She took my hand. Both of our hands were cold from anxiety. Outside was the spring afternoon, warm under the sun; inside the car, in the back seat, the early-morning nip lingered still.</p>
<p>-- It's all just stories, right?</p>
<p>My sister looked at our hands.</p>
<p>-- I hope so---I mean, yeah, just stories.</p>
<p>I squeezed.</p>
<p>-- Be quiet!</p>
<p>Father snapped from the shotgun. We obeyed as always.</p>
<p>We never questioned our parents' orders. We have stopped questioning. We never even asked why we went on this trip, why here, of all places, or why with families of our parents' friends---or why they could even have friends. There must've been some things that we were missing in our lives---things that we, my sister and I, didn't understand. Maybe a concept, or maybe some experiences, or maybe some people.</p>
<p>Three white wooden cabins semi-circled a bonfire pit in the clearing we emerged into. One family each, and here began this weekend trip. Trees thick and tall towered over us; so thick were their branches that they obscured half of the sunlight, and cobwebbed the ground with their shadows where the Fu family parked their car. Their teenage twins, both with square jaws and rough contours of the faces characteristic of the Fus, stepped out and stretched. They greeted our father and mother like two docile dogs greeting their masters without as much of a glance at my sister and I. Mr. and Mrs. Fu nodded at us, and then at our parents, remarking about the smooth drive. From the other side of the Fus' car, where the branches overhead were not as dense, walked out the Chens from their car. They patted my sister's head and my shoulder, laughing about how much we'd grown. We dipped our heads in respect and greeting. I wished we could see the Chens more often. They were the only people who would treat us like they treated their own daughter. Fourteen years old like me, Chen Xi was in my year at school. We'd meet for lunch, and often she'd join me after school to pick up my little sister. She greeted the Fus and our parents, and came over to us.</p>
<p>-- Hi little Shanshan! How are you?</p>
<p>She rubbed my little sister's cheeks, calling her nickname. Jin Shan and Jin Shan---In writing our names were different but when spoken they sounded the same. Shanshan gave her a quick hug after glancing around to make sure our parents weren't looking. Chen Xi saw my face and her smile faltered to worry:</p>
<p>-- Shan, are you alright?</p>
<p>-- No. The Forest---aren't you worried?</p>
<p>She nodded, lips pursed. Though Mystic Forest was not far from our town, the stories had kept us at bay.</p>
<p>-- Childish.</p>
<p>Came the cold scoff from the Fu's sister twin. None of us dared to retaliate. I stared, somewhat apprehensive of the bow she and her brother were stringing. She snapped:</p>
<p>-- What are you looking at, kid?</p>
<p>I dropped my gaze to my feet. My sister clung to my arm and didn't let go until the twin look away. Chen Xi's parents ushered us to the bonfire pit. The grown-ups were assigning cabins to each family and unloading the provisions for the next two days.</p>
<p>-- Get here and help.</p>
<p>Mr. Fu called to the twins.</p>
<p>-- We're going hunting.</p>
<p>The brother grunted. Mrs. Fu objected, and Mr. Fu made to grab them. Nose in the air, the twins stomped into the undergrowth. Chen Xi called after them about the stories of the Forest and to be careful, but they flipped her the bird in unison without looking back, and disappeared.</p>
<p>-- You two, out of our way while we settle the cabin.</p>
<p>Our mother shooed us.</p>
<p>-- Do you want to join us?</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen asked. Chen Xi was an uncanny replica of her mother---they shared the same almond-shaped eyes that I had trouble looking into without blushing. She went on, smiling:</p>
<p>-- You three can team up.</p>
<p>I looked around for my sister's input, and found her beckoning from the info board. There was a ruin close by. She pleaded with her eyes.</p>
<p>-- I really think I should help my parents.</p>
<p>Chen Xi frowned at her mother, then sheepishly at us:</p>
<p>-- I'm sorry... <em>Do</em> be careful, and keep the cabins in sight!</p>
<p>We set off ourselves. Our parents didn't bat an eye as we trod off on the dirt path. It had always been like this: we go off on our own because our parents don't want to be bothered with us. We got in their ways just by existing in their field of vision. <em>Go find something to do.</em> Never a word of caution on our departure or an inquiry of where we went upon our return. If we were lost, I doubt they would even look for us.</p>
<p>-- Brother? How do we know if we meet a Phantom?</p>
<p>-- I---we won't.</p>
<p>We stopped.</p>
<p>-- It's too quiet. I'm scared.</p>
<p>-- So am I. But listen---we are together so the Forest doesn't know whose mind to use for the Phantoms, right?</p>
<p>I crouched down and so did she. I felt nervous, but I needed to be a proper brother:</p>
<p>-- Shanshan, look, the cabins are there through the trees. As soon as we lose sight of it, we turn back, ruins or no, alright?</p>
<p>She nodded. We stood up, Shanshan back to clinging onto my arm.</p>
<p>Our unease subsided as we walked on. The busyness in the forest had pushed their ways into our minds. The undergrowth had just sprouted new leaves, lush bright greens against the dark soil. Dots of petals white or pink or blue unfurled among them and along the path---small things like us, insignificant under the trees and had never seen the real sky. Forest dwellers---squirrels and chipmunks and hares---had already awoke from their wintry sleep and rustled about or scurried up the tall pines and birches. Birds chirped in the sparse rays of the afternoon sun; one fluttered into the undergrowth only to fly out in alarm as a hare leapt away. We thought we saw a deer. The Mystic Forest was as beautiful in reality as it was scary in the stories.</p>
<p>What if all of these were illusions, Phantoms created by the Forest, leading us on? We looked back, and there were the walls of the cabins, white and conspicuous between the brown tree trunks.</p>
<p>What was the point? We were already lost, anyways, lost in the peace of the busy forest, lost in our thoughts. In the welcoming, wet chill, we wondered as we wandered.</p>
<p>How would we know a Phantom? How did the Forest make one? How did it know what was on our minds? What was on the others' minds: the Fu twins, Mr. and Mrs. Chen's, or Chen Xi's? Were we on her mind? Was <em>I</em> on her mind? If we saw her pouting face before us, coming at us, then I'd know we saw a Phantom.</p>
<p>The path opened up and there was the ruin. Shanshan and I grinned at each other as we passed the sign saying, <em>Historical Ruin. Please B1e Careful of Weak Structures.</em> At its feet, the half-full trash bin told us just how people frequented this place. We were not lost.</p>
<p>The ruin was a small, circular structure, open to air either because it never had a roof or the roof had collapsed. The arched marble entryway was much worn and yellowed, saved from tumbling down by thick vines of ivy that also held up what was left of the walls on its either side. A marble workbench---or perhaps an altar---stood opposite the entrance, too conspicuous to ignore. The vines of ivy had crawled over blocks of fallen wall and sprawled over the floor, but avoided the workbench and the way up to it clean. Perhaps they had a mind of their own---or more like the forest rangers had cleared them deliberately.</p>
<p>-- What was this place for?</p>
<p>My sister whispered as we entered. We felt we were in awe. We felt like we were been watched. We felt we were forbidden. We turned around and around, admiring and revering the ancient structure.</p>
<p>-- Could be a workshop, or a temple.</p>
<p>I replied. The walls that still stood were bare beneath the ivies, and so was the workbench upon which we now sat. Nothing gave us a single clue of the history here. Come to think of it, we had never heard any stories about the ruins at all: what they were, who built them, when, why, or how. Nothing was recorded but their existence and abundance, as if nobody had cared. The Phantom was the only thing people ever talked about.</p>
<p>-- Can you still see the cabins?</p>
<p>I asked.</p>
<p>-- A little bit, yeah.</p>
<p>Shanshan replied, kicking her legs. She looked up. I followed suit. Why was I surprised to see the patch of blue overhead? The space within the ruin was the only place free of trees. Shanshan swayed and leant against me, asking:</p>
<p>-- Do mom and dad love us?</p>
<p>-- They feed and clothe us, and pay for our schools. So... yeah.</p>
<p>-- Then why aren't they like Sister Xixi's parents to us?</p>
<p>I didn't answer. She continued:</p>
<p>-- They always bring us birthday presents, and they smile at us just like they do to Sister Xixi. But mom and dad---</p>
<p>She shook her head and buried it in my shoulder:</p>
<p>-- Don't leave me, big brother. I love you.</p>
<p>-- I love you, too. We'll look after each other.</p>
<p>I held up my pinky and she hooked it with hers. We shook them: it was a promise.</p>
<p>When the blue overhead deepened, we hopped to the ground and made our way back.</p>
<p>-- Look, a deer.</p>
<p>Shanshan pointed. This time was for real. The animal nibbled at a flower near the side of the path. Shanshan let go of my hand and approached it, all Phantom stories forgotten. She petted its gentle head and it gazed back at her, munching.</p>
<p>An arrow streaked out from the trees. It grazed the chest of the deer and the animal fled. Shanshan gave a cry of pain and I rushed over. I should never have let her leave my side. This was the Mystic Forest, after all, and anything could---My hands jumped to my eyes when I saw the arrow sticking out of my little sister's thigh. She was trying hard not to cry.</p>
<p>-- Oh no. Oh no, no, no.</p>
<p>I gasped, afraid to touch anything. A rustle made me look up. It was the sister twin with her bow, another arrow notched in place. Her face was impassive---had she have no heart? She blinked once, and scowled:</p>
<p>-- Sorry.</p>
<p>That was all she said before turning back, shouting:</p>
<p>-- I missed the target!</p>
<p>I saw her bother approach, stopped, shrugged, and walked away.</p>
<p>-- HEY!</p>
<p>I couldn't tell what I was trembling from, the presence of the sister twin, my anger at their callousness, or my fear at my own sister's condition. They ignored me. I held Shanshan up:</p>
<p>-- Shanshan---Shanshan! Hey---Let's - let's get it out first!</p>
<p>It was an utter delusion. The slightest touch of my shaking hand at the arrow shaft drew out a scream of pain.</p>
<p>-- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</p>
<p>She sobbed.</p>
<p>-- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</p>
<p>I groaned:</p>
<p>-- I shouldn't have let you go---Can you---can you hold onto big brother's neck? Let's get back first---</p>
<p>She wasn't heavy, but neither was I. I felt my arms gave in some twenty steps later. I gritted my teeth and pressed on. Shanshan gritted hers and held back the tears. I had to keep going---It might get dark fast, and, unable to see the cabins, then we'd both be lost. Shanshan was bleeding now. Blood oozed out and stained her pants. I had to press on. Sniffling as I went I wondered where the Phantoms were now. If one of them had appeared and helped us, I'd give myself up and get lost with them willingly---but <em>only</em> after they help my little sister.</p>

<p>When Chen Xi saw me crashing my way into the clearing with Shanshan half-fainting, she looked horrified and ran to get her parents. Mr. Chen tried to dislodge the arrow, but Shanshan's screams made him reconsider.</p>
<p>-- What now?</p>
<p>Our father came out from our cabin, followed by our mother. They saw us and frowned. Our mother asked:</p>
<p>-- Who did you piss off this time?</p>
<p>-- The twins did this, eh?</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fu examined the arrow.</p>
<p>-- I'm sorry, this is going to hurt.</p>
<p>Mr. Fu crouched down and rolled up his sleeves. He turned to me:</p>
<p>-- Jin Shan, help me hold her down.</p>
<p>His twins chose this moment to return.</p>
<p>-- Look what you two did!</p>
<p>Mrs. Fu shrieked at them:</p>
<p>-- Do you even know you shot someone?</p>
<p>-- Yeah we do.</p>
<p>The brother grunted.</p>
<p>-- We apologized, didn't we?</p>
<p>The sister growled.</p>
<p>-- Apologized? That's all?</p>
<p>Mr. Fu stood up, eyes bulging:</p>
<p>-- Apologized? You could've killed her! What did I teach you two about the first rule of hunting?</p>
<p>The twins glared back at their father, and the sister strode over. I was spent after laying my little sister down, but I dared not let the twins get near her again. I scrambled up to block her advance and was shoved aside.</p>
<p>-- Out of my way.</p>
<p>She snapped. Shanshan tried to crawl backwards but the twin sat on her stomach to pin her down, and snapped off the shaft. My hairs stood on their ends as my little sister squealed and fainted. The twin stood up and threw the shaft at my side:</p>
<p>-- There. That's what you wanted, right? This is a reminder of not getting in the way of people's hunting.</p>
<p>-- What? <em>This</em> is what you---</p>
<p>-- What else do you want? We've already apologized, okay? It's not like we killed her!</p>
<p>The twin brother yelled from aside.</p>
<p>-- Not like---! You fucking---</p>
<p>I had never sworn before. It wasn't as effective at expressing my horror or my anger as I had imagined. I struggled up and lunged at the nearest twin. The sister kicked me back. Her brother would've run at me had his mother not grabbed him. I made for her over and over again, and was beat back each time. Mrs. Chen tried to hold me back while her husband tried to constrain the twin. I screamed:</p>
<p>-- You moron! You fucking bastard! You piece of garbage! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Give me a gun and I'll shoot you into a dice! Give me a gun! Gimme a gun! I'll kill you!</p>
<p>I think it was to everyone's surprise when my father thrust his pistol in my face. I choked halfway through a word and saw his irritated face next to it.</p>
<p>-- Go on, take it and shoot.</p>
<p>He sounded irascible:</p>
<p>-- End this fiasco already. We'll pay the price. Go on. That's what you want, eh? Go on. You got a spine or not?</p>
<p>We glared at each other. For the first time in my life I felt hatred toward this man, and the woman who bore me. They hadn't come near us until now, and not a word of concern came from either of them. <em>Who did you piss off this time?</em> Oh it was our fault, was it? They fed us, they clothed us, they accommodated us: material needs were all there were. People had treated their pets better, and now, the pistol: another material support.</p>
<p>I ripped the pistol out of my father's hand and pointed it at the twin. She kept up her menacing glare.</p>
<p>-- Go on. It's already loaded. What, don't have the balls for it?</p>
<p>My father sneered.</p>
<p>-- Go on. Just remember if you kill one person you'll never go back, boy.</p>
<p>My mother jeered from steps away, arms crossed.</p>
<p>-- What are you two saying?</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen found her voice. She tried to lower my arm, and whispered into my ear:</p>
<p>-- Xiao Shan, don't do it. Listen to Auntie, Xiao Shan, don't do it! You can't do this---</p>
<p>I broke free of her and stuck the pistol against the sister's head. I ignored Mr. Chen's whispers, too. All I could think of was that I would enjoy this, I would enjoy this, I would enjoy this. Nothing---nobody---would stop me. I sneered and felt my arm buckle away.</p>
<p>Chen Xi, one hand around my hand and the other in the crook of my arm, gently guided me away from the twin.</p>
<p>-- Please don't do this, Shan. Don't listen to them! You don't want to do this. Let it go---I know you're worried about Shanshan but look---she's fine for now, just fainted---my parents'll get her to the clinic tomorrow, first thing in the morning! Drop the pistol---come on, just drop it---I don't want you to be a murderer! Neither does Shanshan! Yes, drop---there, there...</p>
<p>My legs gave away under her whimpers. What had come over me? Now, there was only remorse. It seeped into my body with Chen Xi's fragrance. They replaced the last bit of strength I had left. What madness had come over me? Was it the Forest's spell? I didn't dare to look at the others. The loathsome pistol was by my feet and I didn't want to look at that, either.</p>
<p>My father picked it up and returned to the cabin. I heard my mother spat:</p>
<p>-- Oh the drama!</p>
<center>
#
</center>
<p>I woke up to relieve myself, and it was a while before I remembered where I was. I took care climbing down the ladder of my bed to not wake my sister on the bunker below. Her forehead started burning before we had turned in, and I could feel the heat as I reached the floor.</p>
<p>In the mirror of the bathroom was the haggard me. My hair was disheveled from the tossing and turning in my sleep and my fringes were plastered to my forehead. My eyes were bigger and wilder than they really were above my hollow cheeks. I looked lost. My little sister was in pain and fever, and neither of my parents bothered to provide care. How could the others ever be friends with them? Especially the Chens---would they shun us from now on? Mr. Fu had pulled my father aside after dinner, looking serious---he and Mrs. Fu had been at each other‘s ears ever since the scene I'd made. He and my father made the business quick, whatever it was. They had come back, each stuffing away their wallets and phones, laughing like nothing had ever happened. What? How?</p>
<p>-- Nobody would talk to me anymore, not after they saw what I tried to do.</p>
<p>I said to my reflection. I had been avoiding everyone, especially Chen Xi. When she had called me for dinner I pretended not to have heard her at my sister's side, not moving until she had left. I felt ashamed. What would she think of me now? A murderer? An unstable madman? She reassured me again that her parents would drive Shanshan to the nearest clinic the next morning when we did the dishes. I wished we could get her there <em>now</em>. My little sister needed help <em>now</em>. What if her fever did damage to her brain? What if she missed the optimal treatment time by then and lost her leg?</p>
<p>A tap came from the window and I jumped. Chen Xi's face loomed from the night beyond. I stared. She tapped again with more urgency.</p>
<p><em>We need to get the arrowhead out</em> were the first words she said when I slid the window open:</p>
<p>-- Let's get her to the ruin nearby. It has a bench that can make things easier. Come.</p>
<p>I lost no time sneaking Shanshan out, wrapped in her quilt. Chen Xi carried a knapsack and an oil lantern. She led the way. On the ground, and around the trees, her flickering flame brought shadows to life. The chilly night was quiet except for the occasional hoots of an owl and our breaths.</p>
<p>-- Aren't you afraid? The Mystic Forest and the Phantoms?</p>
<p>I asked, panting.</p>
<p>-- Not right now.</p>
<p>She didn't turn her head, saying:</p>
<p>-- It's pretty soothing, the Forest, like a mother, protecting all the ruins and secrets within, don't you think so?</p>
<p>-- But the Phantoms and the missing people? What if we---?</p>
<p>I slowed down and leant against a tree. I needed to take a breather. My arms and my body were sore from earlier. She stopped and turned to wait. It was the first time I saw that she was in a simple white gown and bare-foot. With her black hair flowing down she looked beautiful in the flickering light. Give her wings and she'd be an angel. I gaped:</p>
<p>-- Aren't you cold?</p>
<p>-- Not if we hurry.</p>
<p>She was rather icy and distant. It had to be what had happened earlier. I should be glad that she wanted to help at all.</p>
<p>She lifted the shield in the lantern when we reached the ruin. In the full light the shadows and the night made the place look even more foreboding. I hesitated before stepping inside. Chen Xi laid her stuff on the marble and pointed where Shanshan should be. I rearranged her quilt so that she had as little contact with the cold surface as possible.</p>
<p>From the knapsack Chen Xi produced a small bottle of clear wine, a lighter, and a paring knife. She poured the liquor over the blade and set it alight. She did the same to a piece of cloth. To my amazement it didn't catch on fire.</p>
<p>-- Would it really work?</p>
<p>-- It's YangShao, 70% alcoholic content.</p>
<p>She replied.</p>
<p>-- Where did you get all these?</p>
<p>-- My parents' stuff.</p>
<p>It came so curt that it hurt. I backed off, but she ordered me to stay by my sister's side. She rolled off Shanshan's pajamas.</p>
<p>I gasped at the swollen leg. The flesh around the wound was dark purple. The whole thigh flared like it'd explode. Unfazed, Chen Xi dabbed the area with the liquor. Shanshan groaned, and flung open her eyes. They were full of terror.</p>
<p>-- Big brother, where are you---</p>
<p>-- I'm here. I'm here. Look, Sister Xixi is going to help you. It'll be alright...</p>
<p>-- Flip her around and wipe this on her forehead and back. It helps with the fever.</p>
<p>Chen Xi handed me the cloth and the liquor. I was about to object when she looked at me straight in the eye and said:</p>
<p>-- Don't worry about the cold. She's already having a fever.</p>
<p>I obeyed. She took the knife and made two cuts around the wound. Shanshan moaned in pain and delirium. I tried my best to calm her. The groans became louder as Chen Xi pried and worked her way around the metal with the paring knife.</p>
<p><em>Should've done this with the shaft still in there.</em> I thought.</p>
<p>-- Never should've let her snap the arrow off.</p>
<p>Chen Xi muttered.</p>
<p>Shanshan had fainted again from pain. It was probably for the best. With one final prick she took the arrow head out. It was a small thing, no bigger than my pinky nail, bloody but otherwise intact. The wound shouldn't be deep based on the size of this. Chen Xi sanitized the cloth again and wiped the black blood off the wound. She put a piece of gauze to it and secured it with bandages. I watched her press her hands over the wound and close her eyes, as though praying.</p>
<p>-- She should be fine now.</p>
<p>-- Thank you... I didn't know you can do operations.</p>
<p>-- I wanted to try. Maybe... maybe I should be a doctor.</p>
<p>She gave a nod, already cleaning up. I missed her smiles. I guessed it meant that something had really changed between us. Sullen, I turned to my sister to avoid looking at Chen Xi, but she tapped my shoulder, a faint pouting smile around her lips:</p>
<p>-- Hey... take her back now. She'll be alright.</p>
<p>-- I should help cleaning up.</p>
<p>-- Don't worry about me. I'll be fast. You go ahead. Be careful.</p>

<p>My little sister patted me awake. It took me a second to realize how unusual this was. I snapped my eyes open, and there she was, kneeling by my side on the upper bunker. Shafts of sunlight peaked through the curtains and lit up her excited smile.</p>
<p>-- You climbed up yourself?</p>
<p>I asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>-- Yes! Look!</p>
<p>She pulled down her pajamas to show me her thigh. She had taken the bandages off. The swell had subsided. A half-closed white scar replaced the wound and the cut.</p>
<p>-- This is great! It's a miracle.</p>
<p>I breathed and hugged her:</p>
<p>-- Put the bandages back on, Shanshan. It still needs to heal. You really shouldn't have taken them off.</p>
<p>She nodded:</p>
<p>-- I'm sorry. I was curious---</p>
<p>-- What are you two doing now?</p>
<p>Our mother's sleepy voice, full of disapproval, came from across the room.</p>
<p>-- Look, mom. My leg's healed!</p>
<p>Shanshan dangled her leg over the bunker railing.</p>
<p>-- Great. We don't need to visit the clinic anymore.</p>
<p>She flipped back to the other side.</p>
<p>I took out the arrowhead from my jeans pocket and showed it to Shanshan:</p>
<p>-- Can you remember what happened last night?</p>
<p>-- I'll thank Sister Xixi at first chance!</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Chen weren't completely convinced that my little sister didn't need more medical attention, but my parents waved their worries away. Even Shanshan skipped around to put them at ease:</p>
<p>-- It was all thanks to Sister Xixi!</p>
<p>-- Oh really?</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen smiled to hide her bemusement.</p>
<p>After breakfast we prepared for the day's trek. Mr. Fu took the lead:</p>
<p>-- Okay. To be safe, let's stick with our own families and keep each other in sight---WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!</p>
<p>-- Hunting. We're going ahead.</p>
<p>Grunted the brother twin.</p>
<p>-- So we shoot nobody.</p>
<p>The twin sister scoffed.</p>
<p>They strode off without another word.</p>
<p><em>Good riddance.</em> I thought, grabbing my little sister's hand, and we set off.</p>
<p>-- Stay on the path and don't follow strangers, hear that?</p>
<p>Our father said, impatient as ever:</p>
<p>-- This is the Mystic Forest, you hear? I said, you hear?</p>
<p>-- Yes, father.</p>
<p>We chanted.</p>
<p>The Forest in the morning was true to its name, and more eerie than it was at night. It was shrouded in a mist that dampened all sounds and dulled all senses. Pale streaks of sunlight fought their ways in from between the branches, long fingers reaching for us, passing over us, as though they would grab us any second. It was strangely beautiful, as well. The quiet and the chill of April, the mushy soil under our feet, the veiled greens, every feature we see with our eyes was painted a faint pale blue---it was a heavenly place. Peace, eerie peace, that was what the Mystic Forest was about.</p>
<p>-- I'm beginning to like this place.</p>
<p>My little sister whispered. I nodded. She was holding up well. Chen Xi really did an amazing job.</p>
<p>We walked, following the main trail, rested for a bit after an hour or so, and continued our way. We saw some hare and one or two deer again. They scurried off at our approach or stood observing us from afar in the undergrowth. We met no people, not even the twins. Surely there should be other hikers by now? Not everyone could afford the cabins but wouldn't the campers usually stay overnight in their tents deeper ways in? Were they coming back out, we would meet them by now.</p>
<p>I noticed my shoelace had come apart, and crouched down at a fork to redo them. Shanshan called for our parents to stop. They did and turned. Two seconds later they told me to hurry up and strolled ahead with Shanshan in tow.</p>
<p>I need to get back to them quick. This was the Mystic Forest, after all---Would anyone look for me if the Phantoms <em>did</em> get me?</p>
<p>I stood up to three kids walking up the other path. One of them said to me:</p>
<p>-- There you are. Somebody's calling for you.</p>
<p>They were quite small, eight or nine, a boy and two girls. Puzzled, I looked at them. Their big eyes glared back in disapproval. What did I do this time?</p>
<p>-- Come on already. Someone there is calling you.</p>
<p>One of the girls urged.</p>
<p>Their eyes looked familiar somehow. The shapes, the glare... they tickled my memory and for a brief second I thought I recognized them. I followed her finger down the path and saw a group of elementary school kids sitting and running around the clearing at the bottom of the slope. Who'd take them on a field trip <em>here</em>? Who over <em>there</em> would call <em>me</em>? I lifted my foot to follow.</p>
<p>It was as though a chord was plucked inside my head. My father's voice reverberated as its echo: <em>Stay on the path and don't follow strangers, you hear?</em> I have never in my life felt so happy to oblige the irritated voice. How could I ever forget the stories at this time? I retracted my foot:</p>
<p>-- I'm sorry. There's somebody who need me more right now. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I fled away as polite as I could manage. My family hadn't gone far. They lagged behind the other two, strolling along as though waiting for me.</p>
<p>-- There you are. What, can't even tie knots anymore?</p>
<p>Our mother snapped.</p>
<p>-- Thanks for waiting.</p>
<p>I was grateful.</p>

<p>The Fu twins weren't there when we returned to the cabins. We hadn't seen them at all during our walk.</p>
<p>-- <em>The number you dialed was not available.</em></p>
<p>Mrs. Fu repeated, holding her phone:</p>
<p>-- Can they go that deep in, or...?</p>
<p>She furrowed her brow at her husband. We knew what she was thinking. Our hearts sank. Mr. Chen was already by the landline:</p>
<p>-- Let's call the rangers.</p>
<p>The rangers arrived in a squad of six and set off for an immediate search. We children were ordered to stay in the campground while the adults went with them. We sat on the floor in the Chen's cabin, and dozed off from exhaustion of the trek.</p>
<p>We woke to an evening. Mr. Chen came into his cabin with our dinner, and told us that no one had been found, yet.</p>
<p>-- The police are here, too. It's best for you children to stay here.</p>
<p>He sat down:</p>
<p>-- Don't worry. You'll be safe. Jin Shan, your parents are talking with them right now and the Fus are out with the rangers again. Your auntie and I will be around. You and Shanshan stay here for the night, alright?</p>
<p>My little sister and I nodded. He watched us eat, and left with our plates.</p>
<p>-- Great Mother God.</p>
<p>Chen Xi hugged her knees:</p>
<p>-- I know they are horrible but to go missing here---It must be the Phantoms...</p>
<p>I grimaced. Shanshan clung to my arm tighter:</p>
<p>-- Do you think we should go help searching?</p>
<p>-- We can take your dad's lantern again.</p>
<p>I suggested to Chen Xi.</p>
<p>-- Lantern? What---? We don't have one.</p>
