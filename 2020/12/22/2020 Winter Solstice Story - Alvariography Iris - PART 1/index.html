-- Orphanage --
</center>
<p>When they finally reached their street, Iris and Rubik were soaked. The water weighed down their gray and white cotton clothes. With every step Iris felt gross in her shoes. She had changed her hair to a ponytail, because the bun she had tied for keeping hair out of her face became just too heavy. The black waterfall of hair swung and tugged as she ran, so she clutched it to her chest.</p>
<p>The street was just like any other in the city: grey, rough, littered with puddles of mud and blood---aftermaths of a skirmish, one of many that plagued the city since the Civil War had begun 20 years ago, longer than Iris could ever remember.</p>
<p>"Rubik, is this really the time?" Iris called. She ran after him and reached out a ginger hand to pry him away from the bodies that lay scattered along the curb. Every day volunteers dragged new victims of war off the road, and every week they hauled them out of the city for burial. "Ugh." Iris recoiled and backed under a building. Even the heavy rain couldn't wash away the stench or the horrid expressions on their faces.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>"Just a sec, babe. This one's new---" He patted down the body with deft fingers. They used to be street urchins before they were taken in. The war had torn their lives apart without a warning. Three days after her sixth birthday, the raid alarm sounded and Iris' parents shoved her into the cellar. It was Rubik and his grandmother from next door who let her out. Iris couldn't recall much after seeing her home in ruins around her. She <em>could</em> recall, however, how fast Rubik had picked up the bad habit of thieving. But then again, it was exactly that survival instinct that had kept them alive after his grandmother had died. All that remained of the habit was looting dead bodies after the orphanage happened. Rubik sighed. "Stripped clean. Ah well."</p>
<p>Thunder cracked overhead. Iris stifled a frightened squeal. Rubik leapt up and ran over. The rain was thick enough for him to wash the grime off his hands before pulling Iris into his arms.</p>
<p>"Boy! I squeezed water out of you!" He laughed. With Iris in one arm and their snakeskin bags of grocery secure on his back, he rushed down the street and whisked into a side road. <em>Pitpat pitpat</em> went the rain on the canopy above, like the marching of troops. Below the leaves, however, the path was dry. "We're home." He swept a thick wet lock of hair off of Iris' face. Another clasp of thunder and Iris flinched. He gave a swift check around and kissed her.</p>
<p>"It's okay - it's okay." He soothed. "Always wanna ask---what's so scary about thunder?"</p>
<p>"Reminds me of the cannons." Iris mumbled. They had seen those once too many when they were still in the suburbs. None had been inside the city, yet, thank Mother God. She set her hair loose and squeezed down along its length. Water poured by her feet. <em>Splat. Splat.</em></p>
<p>"There you are!" A rather plump girl of their age ran down the path, two umbrellas in hand. She was dressed in a dark navy dress. Under her leveled black fringes were eyes of disapproval, and the effect was enhanced by her tight bun, not a wisp of flyaway hair could be seen. "Madam Yu was starting to worry!" She grabbed Iris' hands. "Iris, you're soaked!"</p>
<p>"Hey, so am I! Gimme a share of care, too, yeah?" Rubik pressed his messy black hair and tilted his head to avoid the running water. A streak still slid down his thin face. He was starting to grow facial hair, Iris noticed. What would it become, those soft tufts? A mustache or a goatee?</p>
<p>"I saw what you did!" The girl hissed. "Spit it out, what else have you done to her?" They trudged back.</p>
<p>"Why are you always accusing me like that?" Rubik pulled a face, "and why do you always sound so eager?" The girl screwed up her face and poked an umbrella at him. He dodged, sniggering.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Anne." Iris pulled her friend to her other side, couldn't help smiling a bit. "It's okay."</p>
<p>"Humph." Anne clasped onto Iris' arm.</p>
<p>The side road curved and turned and opened to a yard surrounded by woods. Iris took a deep breath: the scent of damp soil was soothing. Trees---ginkgo and willow, mostly, but also plain old sycamore---dotted the yard. Laundry lines stood empty in the middle of the field to their left. A blooming flower patch of irises and lilies and sunflowers flourished in the field to their right. Further than that were a small crop field and a playground. <em>No cleaning duties needed for the swings or the slides with this pouring rain, now.</em> Iris sighed inside.</p>
<p>The trees that had sheltered them so far stretched further along the path, all the way to the stone steps leading up to the red oak door of a mansion. The two-storied building spanned across the yard, its white stone walls almost glowed under the gray sky and against the muted green trees. Its roof was covered in solar panels. These were installed years ago to save money in the long run. Power was hard to come by in the war.</p>
<p>(<em>With this rain, the reservoir out in the woods would be full for a long while.</em>)</p>
<p>This hidden plot of paradise in the middle of the city was owned by a wealthy merchant family. Now, only the merchant's widow and a few servants remained. It had seen better days, but at least it was a decent home, to Iris, Anne, and Rubik, and 40 more orphans like them.</p>

<p>"---Good God, can you girls do nothing?" The head chef bawled as Iris, now dried, and another girl, Fay, failed to lift the cast iron pot together. "It's just a pot of soup! All water! Don't even have nothing inside!"</p>
<p>"Shall we thank you for your frugality, sir?" Rubik looked up from his chopping board, smirking. "You guys wanna switch?" He cleaned his hands and went over. The boy he teamed up with followed suit.</p>
<p>Iris and Fay took up the knives and set chopping. Girls at the orphanage hated back-of-house kitchen duties solely because of the head chef. He favored the boys, and never missed an opportunity to snap at the girls. Iris always felt an ominous vibe coming from him, and the older she grew, the stronger it became. The only woman he respected was the Matron, Madam Yu. He had to. She paid his wages.</p>
<p>"Misogynic creep." Fay muttered.</p>
<p>"<em>Misogynous</em>." Iris whispered.</p>
<p>"Whatever. Did you hear, Iris? What he said to Cam the other day?"</p>
<p>Iris frowned. The head chef picked on Camilla, one of the orphans who stayed as an assistant caretaker after her coming of age, more than on anyone else. Iris thought Cam pretty, but was too fussy with her. It wasn't until her sixteenth birthday that Cam told her how much Iris resembled her younger self, and thus the extra care.</p>
<p>"Mum should really fire him---"</p>
<p>"Spend your time <em>chopping</em> instead of <em>talking</em>!" The head chef growled from the stoves, banging the spatula on the wok. Iris suppressed a shutter as a flying bullet flashed across her mind. She bent her head and said nothing. "Girls," the head chef went on, "good for nothing but talking. You'd think you can send them onto the battlefield and they'd <em>talk</em> the enemy to death, but nope!"</p>
<p><em>It's not like you're out there fighting or anything.</em> Contemptuous, Iris chopped her cabbages with a tad more aggression than she had meant to.</p>
<p>"Great Mother God, how I want to kick him between his legs." Fay hissed. Iris stifled a snort.</p>
<p>"Uh... speaking of battlefields," a chef started, "the local butcher said the main force of the People's Army might be here soon. The Liberation Army is asking for more rations of late, and let slip that their reinforcements are coming in from the north. They're setting up heavier defenses, too."</p>
<p>"So they are fighting over this city?" Another asked.</p>
<p>"About damn time!" The head chef banged the wok again. "Five years before the Liberals remembered this city, and fifteen years of skirmishes before People's Party decided we're important enough for taking!"</p>
<p>"Where's their line of defense?" Fay piped up.</p>
<p>"Shut up, you---"</p>
<p>"Down south, People's Boulevard." The gruff chef behind them cut across the head chef. The girls gaped at him. That wasn't too far away. People's Boulevard was the main street that cut the city in half east to west, four blocks from theirs. The Liberation Army camp was three more blocks up north. "You girls be careful heading out, yeah? If it's true, there'll be more skirmishes around this part."</p>
<p>"They're also bringing in tanks and mortars and stuff." A younger chef nodded solemnly. "Might come tomorrow, or a week later. Who knows."</p>
<p>"That's life now." Fay mumbled. "Why can't they just kill each other and settle the score here for good."</p>
<p>Iris made a non-committal grunt. She could never figure out which side she should be supporting. Neither side seemed alright. What was the L.A. liberating them from? If the P.A. was for the people, why was there a war ruining people's life in the first place? She never bothered asking. What could she do about the war, anyways.</p>
<p>The dining hall was wide and well-lit. Three rows of table ran along the length of the chamber below the chandeliers. Up upon the wall were framed sepia photos of each orphan’s birthday. Behind those, the wallpaper was a fabric of floral patterns. Down below, along the bottom third of the wall were smooth ebony planks. A long table laden with trays of food and pots of soup was at the front, where Iris and her duty partners stood waiting for Madam Yu's signal. Iris always thought Madam Yu looked haughty, shrewd, and strict. Steely eyes, high cheekbones, a sharp nose, and pursed lips, Madam Yu was indeed all those, as well as much, much more. Her hands, growing rougher every year, were the ones Iris would think of when she thought of the phrase, "mother's hands". Now Madam Yu raised them both and, with an affirmative smile, gave the children by the tables a brisk beckon and a firm nod. There was a flurry of shuffles and wooden bench scraping the wooden floor, and one by one, children from four-year-olds waddling beside the older ones who led them on to sixteen-year-olds flipping and twirling their plate in their hands, all in hand-sewn cotton clothes, lined up in the front of the hall.</p>
<p>Madam Yu steadied each of their wares with one hand and cut into the rice with a spatula with the other, greeting them and asking, "Less or more?" She made occasional comments, or gave a child a loving tap on the nose, or cracked passing jokes with the older ones. Every child present was picked off the streets by her. She tried to give what had been taken from them: food, shelter, clothes, and love---a childhood. She had the resources, as Madam Yu had always told herself. The Bai Yu who had married into the Kang Family decades ago was rendered sterile in a car accident, and she would never had dared to imagine herself mothering 40 children. Twenty years of giving gave her wrinkles and white hairs, as well as the loving title, "mum". It was all good.</p>
<p>None of this would've happened had that girl not collapsed in her yard when the war had just started. Bloody shrapnel wounds covered her body. The trail in the dirt showed she had been dragging herself. By her side was a crying little boy, cleaner than her but no less wounded. She had escaped here with her son from the capital, where the war had started. That was all they could learn. She didn't make it. Her boy did. The fear in his eyes kindled something new in the widow: something she had never felt in her 42 years of life, for there had never been the need for it. She wondered why it hadn't awakened sooner.</p>
<p>She had the money. She couldn't save everyone, but she could at least help the children. She had scoured the streets for orphans since.</p>
<p>The first boy who had started this all now stood next to her with a patch over his left eye and a scarred left cheek. He had stayed to help after coming of age, like Camilla next to him, and the other caretakers. They were Madam Yu's extra hands, comforting the newcomers and breaking up fights, carrying out duties unfit for the younger children and assisting the homeschooling teachers with classes and homework. The life in the orphanage was the only life they knew, and they were content sticking to it.</p>
<p>Not that there hadn't been people who <em>did</em> leave. The local butcher who tipped the chef off probably knew Yubo, who had left to learn the trade two years ago. There had been many who left the city for the coast, and maybe even fled overseas. A few had been drafted into the L.A. Some had married. One, Iris was told by a scandalized Madam Yu, became a prostitute, married to a general, and absconded with him overseas.</p>
<p>It was only one more year until Iris became 18 herself. She had already made up her mind to live out her life in the orphanage. She had nothing out there, but in here, she had everything: people to love and to take care of, chores to be done, a life. The life at the orphanage was the closest to what little she could remember of what she had lost. She couldn't bear to lose again. The only thorn would be the head chef, but one couldn't have everything.</p>
<p>But if the war <em>did</em> come into the city... The memory of a shell blasting the ground apart and sending everything flying---tree trunks, cement chunks, pipe pieces, and Rubik's grandmother---</p>
<p><em>No, don't think about it.</em> Iris gritted her teeth and blocked the memory out. She avoided Anne's shrewd gaze and steadied her arm. <em>Things'll be alright, and Rubik and I'll stay here, safe, and end up getting---</em></p>
<p>"Big sister Iris?" A small boy looked up from his filled bowl.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Iris snapped out of it. "More, Timmy?" She reached for a spare bowl.</p>
<p>"No, um..." He went red. The girl next to him smirked. He held up a twig of orchid.</p>
<p>"Why, thank you, Timmy!" Iris leant to let the small boy put it in her hair.</p>
<p>"Um... Will you marry me when I grow up?"</p>
<p>Iris gave a light snort, and Anne doubled up laughing beside her, dropping her tongs. Iris patted Timmy's head.</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll see." <em>Things will be alright.</em> She thought.</p>

<p>It was always a relief when the sun came out. This was when the only birds in the city showed signs of life in the surrounding woods. Some would even leave their shelters and out into the yard. This was also when the orphans vacated the mansion, filling the air with their jubilations that echoed in the grand blue above. Sunny days, especially in the summer, reminded Iris that life could be hopeful, and that happiness still existed.</p>
<p>She breathed in the scent of laundry. She hung up the soaked dress from yesterday and watched it sway to a halt. Iris turned around. Between the running children she saw Mr. Gao putting his bag down by the large ginkgo tree. It was time for her tutoring duty. She made her way across the yard. On the path to the outside she bade Rubik and another boy leaving for an errand be careful, and steadied a girl who ran too fast and almost tripped. <em>Lively.</em> She thought. As she approached him, she saw a thin ring of gold on the leaves.</p>
<p>"Isn't it too early for this?" She nodded her greeting to Mr. Gao and pointed at the leaves.</p>
<p>"Perhaps we're in for a harsh winter, Iris, dear." Iris always liked his warm voice. He took off his straw hat and hang it on a low branch. "Help me put up the poster, if you please."</p>
<p><em>Ah, history.</em> Iris pulled a face. Tutor duties were on a rotating basis. Madam Yu may be kind but she'd rather die than be lax on the orphans' education. In the early years she sent them to school, escorting them herself. When the skirmishes intensified, she bought a bullet proof van and had her valet drive them. Later, when schools closed down, she interviewed and hired two teachers: renowned Mr. Li Gao from the City Middle School and Ms. Ling Sue from a private elementary school.</p>
<p>"Look alive, Iris. Shan't give the kids wrong impressions." Mr. Gao came back to help. He swept away the thin hair on his balding forehead.</p>
<p>"It's boring. I should've swapped with Fay. <em>She's</em> the history one." Iris gave a cheeky pout at Mr. Gao's grin. She saw lines at the corner of his eyes and lips. They hadn't been there when he had first taught her.</p>
<p>"Boring? It's intertwined with literature! How can you like one but not the other? You did well in history, yourself."</p>
<p>"Probably because one doesn't always need to have wars in stories." Iris frowned even deeper. "Literature is flexible. I can write my own ending if I don't like a story. But history? We're stuck with it, however much we may regret."</p>
<p>"Much like this war. Very wise, Iris." Mr. Gao stabbed the pins into the poster. Iris didn't respond. She had never heard him even mention the war in class, if ever outside of it. "Don't tell anyone... Mrs. Yu frowns upon contemporary politics in class but we aren't in one yet---this war is rigged from the start."</p>
<p>"What?" Iris asked despite herself. Conspiracies were the last thing she had expected from him.</p>
<p>"Yes, rigged. Look, the Liberal Party and the People's Party co-existed for two centuries after the end of the Colonial Era," Mr. Gao muttered to the poster, all smiles gone. "There has been no serious tension between the two before war. The day prior they were signing joint amendments for a more inclusive freedom of speech, and the following day the liberals handed in a draft motion for a single-party government to the General Assembly. Nobody could pinpoint the originator of the idea. It was as if the Liberals and the President went mad overnight. The third day, the People's Party unveiled their hitherto non-existent military. Remember that the army in this country obeys the General Assembly, which the Liberals hold the majority. Where did any of these things come from, and so fast? We've never known we had resources to fight among ourselves for 20 years straight, either. This civil war has been the bloodiest and the most devastating war yet, and they are still at a literal stalemate on each front. How is that possible with no foreign intervention at all?"</p>
<p>"Right... Conspiracies..." Iris refocused her attention just in time. She heard enough to ask, just to be polite, "Is that why mum doesn't allow you to teach it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, now you're interested?" Mr. Gao tilted his head. "Have you ever thought about college, Iris?" She stared. "They study more recent events there without much restriction, though it'll be hard to attend one within the country now... The most prestigious schools had to band together and move to the border to avoid war. It's better to just leave the country... Just a thought."</p>
<p>"I'm going nowhere."</p>
<p>"Listen, Iris. I should've had this talk with you last year." Mr. Gao held onto her shoulder with on hand and held up a finger with the other. His black eyes had those piercing look of whenever he tried to drill a concept into the class' heads. Iris thought that his aging couldn't be more obvious. "Listen... you've got a knack for the academia. I still have your final essay on literary comparison between the East and the West---way beyond the understanding of an average sixteen-year-old. I would be devastated---<em>devastated!</em>---if you ended up as a mere housewife, you hear that? <em>Devastated! Go to college! Change your life! Leave the country if you have to!</em>" He shook his finger and yelled.</p>
<p>"R-right." Iris took a startled step back. She should've just kept her mouth shut all along. Mr. Gao swept aside his hair again, which had fallen from his agitation. He knocked on his forehead and eased himself.</p>
<p>"My apologies." He patted her shoulder. "Let's gather the kids for class." Iris nodded, still a bit shaken. Mr. Gao called after her as she went, "Do consider it, though, yeah?"</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>The butcher who tipped off the chefs had been right. By September, tanks had pulled into the city, patrolling the streets alongside squadrons of soldiers. Planes were also sighted overhead more often, passing twice every hour. Sometimes they were higher up, but most of the time they were low enough for Iris to see the flags at their side. The red ones with three golden stars in the middle were the Liberation Army; the half red-half yellow ones were the People's Party. Whenever the latter showed up, there would guaranteed be a missile or two flying at it. Iris know when to hide. The patrols would blare warnings to the civilians in the buildings as they went, telling them to stay off the street or to evacuate. Most of the time, these irritating screeches were drowned by the whistles and explosions of mortar shells.</p>
<p>Life at the orphanage became miserable. Blasts could be heard for miles around; even when it was too far away, the orphans could still feel the quakes under their feet. The death toll made the errand duties a test of courage. Body heaps weren't exclusive to People's Boulevard anymore. Iris had never seen so many on their own street. It was an Indian Summer, and the foul stench kept even Rubik away. The volunteers couldn't keep up. It wasn't long before they stopped because of the Liberation Army's imposed curfew. All violators were to be killed on sight. The market they frequented added two more pieces of steel board to their pre-existing ones that guarded the entrance; the supplies dwindled, as well: more troops were garrisoned in the city, sapping the stockpile and redirecting the produce suppliers entering the city to their own storehouses.</p>
<p>"At some point we won't be able to go out at all." Fay said one dinner, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Mum was beating herself up for not buying live chickens and hens earlier." Rubik replied, all his usual frivolousness evaporated. "She asked us to till more land in the yard. We had to uproot half of the flower patch for it. I'm sorry." He glanced at a horrified Iris. "You're the only iris here now."</p>
<p>"It used to be guerrilla warfare." Mr. Gao made a rare appearance one dinner. Everybody was present: Madam Yu, Ms. Sue, the chefs, the servants, and even the two teacher's families. A grim air hung over the hall. "That means the People's Army was sending smaller groups of soldiers to harass the Liberation Army, hoping to chip away their strength and control. It seems that the People's Army deemed their efforts have paid off and their time has come. News is that they are amassing to the south of the city with heavy weaponry: tanks, mortar, cannons, and are advancing into the city. The Liberation Army is responding with equal measure. I'm afraid they might finally clash head-on."</p>
<p>The orphans exchanged worried looks. The adults in the front frowned at the floor. Somebody knocked a spoon off the table. The <em>clang</em> reverberated for a long while.</p>
<p>"More Liberation Army reinforcements are due in a few weeks." Mr. Gao checked the newspaper in his hand, and passed it to Madam Yu and Ms. Sue. "They will keep hoarding resources. A stray shell might cut our grid, too."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Li. There's still time to prepare. We cannot let our children out to the streets anymore." Madam Yu said, glancing the article.</p>
<p>"No. I'm afraid not." Mr. Gao replied. "We should think about evacuation, seeing how the situation escalated in other cities. Right now it's only drones flying up there. Those could become---"</p>
<p>"If anything happens, we'll flee into the bunker in the woods by way of the basement. Children, we will have an evacuation drill tomorrow. Staffs. meeting in the reading parlor at 7:30, please." Madam Yu cut in. "No need to startle everyone further." She whispered into Mr. Gao's ear, yet already a small girl was whimpering at the table behind Iris, Fay, and Anne. Anne turned and drew her in.</p>
<p>"Are we going to die?" Her muffled voice was thin. The younger children who heard her started to snivel, too. They looked at Anne. Anne looked at the girl in her arms.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. We won't." She whispered. "Tina, it'll be alright, okay? It'll be alright."</p>
<p>It did not go alright. Coming November, their meals were cut down to having porridge four days a week. In the first weeks there were still chunks of meat in the bowl; these soon shrank in size, and the orphans would spend more time sifting through the food for bits of nonexistent fat than actual eating. One December day, they were gone from the porridge altogether. During one of their three days of normal meal, Iris found a strip of paper-thin beef in her plate that she could almost see through. She rolled her chopstick. It stuck onto it and disappeared. <em>At least that was one bit of meat.</em> She didn't know whether to laugh or not.</p>
<p>The staffs and some of the older orphans volunteered to save some of their meal portions for the younger children, a few of whom, unable to understand the situation, threw tantrums over the meager amount of their meals. Eventually these ceased. Nobody had extra energy to spare. Even the head chef shut up in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"I never know Anne could look pretty." Rubik said in a carrying whisper one breakfast to Iris, who tore and stacked her slice of bread hardly bigger than her palm. "It must be that she's... <em>not fat</em> anymore."</p>
<p>Iris grimaced. Of all the expressions in the world he had to go for that one. Anne, however, didn't take the bait, but shook her head and gave her bread a bitter grin.</p>
<p>"Just have to be a dick in a time like this." She muttered and fed Tina, who refused to take it. "C'mon, I'm not hungry."</p>
<p>"Sorry. I was trying to make light of it all..." Rubik was sincere.</p>
<p>People had looked to him and some other boys for lively spirits. It was strange how all they used to extract from others with their jokes were silent eye-rolls, whereas now, Madam Yu had them tell a joke before every dinner. The dining hall would heave a collective, exasperated sigh as the highlight of the day.</p>
<p>Iris kept to her room when she wasn't on chore or tutoring duties. When she did step outside, she kept close to the mansion and the woods. The chefs and the servants had taken over the errand duties. Every time they came back, there would always be a piece of bad news: power station explosion; suicide bombers; buildings set on fire; neighborhoods obliterated; one more merchant missing... The People's Army were encroaching the southern district of the city with bombardment tactics. Mortar shells rained down at random. The Liberation Army deployed mortars and cannons as well along the People's Boulevard. Iris felt tired, so tired of the penetrating sounds of explosion from that direction. Even at night, the noise of war didn't cease. Bursts of guns went off like firecrackers. They hammered on her brain.</p>
<p>Iris had forgotten what a sunny day looked like. Her window opened to the south, and she could always see smoke rising beyond the trees and the the buildings, wisps of gray from the weaponry or torrents of black from fire. Sometimes it'd be dust thrown up as well, by buildings tumbling to the ground, carrying god knew how many lives with it, sending a tremor so powerful that Iris had to lift her feet off the floor. The coming snow muffled the cannon blasts somewhat, and also silenced the birds. The air was so dead that Iris began to wonder: <em>had</em> there been any birds before? That day when Mr. Gao told her to go abroad for school was vague like the buildings in the haze. <em>Leave the country if you have to.</em> Death---that was what the haze was, and it drew closer with each passing day. <em>When will it arrive? I'm not ready...</em> Iris forced herself not to think about it without avail. <em>Death is coming. Leave the country.</em> She shook her head. Her stomach growled.</p>
<p>She leaned against the window. Cold panels met her forehead and she pressed on. Black smoke in the distance to the right. <em>They are burning the park.</em> Iris thought. The hilltop park that Madam Yu used to take them to years ago, when things weren't that bad, when skirmishes were the only open conflict, when cannons and mortar were confined only to the suburbs. Standing atop of that hill in the afternoon sun, overlooking the city that was yet to be broken, watching how a thin veil of glory coated the aged buildings and graffitied the sky, she had thought it would all be better. The city used to be beautiful. Its hills made the landscape three-dimensional. Buildings layered over each other, one row after the next, like a bastion. There were cathedrals and churches, at least two hundred years old, from the Colonial Era, watching the much younger skyscrapers across the city, red bricks in the west and gray steels in the east. Together with the trees they hid the body-ridden streets and gutters below. The view would be much different now. They had stopped going up there for years. Rubik would sneak her over on their errand duties, however. The two of them would hide in the shades of the grove, watching the smoke and lights from the skirmishes below. Rubik might steal a kiss, but that was all. The time when they could be the only ones in the world... Iris returned to her desk.</p>
<p>Those days might never be again.</p>
<p><em>Oh no. Those days</em> will <em>never be again.</em> She had to stop deluding herself. For one, the war. Things were already going south at a fast pace since the war was brought to their doorsteps. The orphanage wasn't a fort; it would not hold on for long. Who knew when the war in the city would end, either: if a civil war could go on outside for 20 years, then it'd go on in here for 20 years---or even 40, 70, a century. They'd be long gone before it was over. For another---<em>gone.</em> They'd be <em>gone</em>---to another city, another country. Specifically, <em>them</em>: Iris, Rubik, and five other orphans neither too old to be indispensable to the daily functions of the orphanage nor too young to be undependable to carry out an task.</p>
<p>"I need to send you away." These words were calm and firm, gray and nonchalant as the sky overhead. Madam Yu had them for a walk yesterday. The woods around their orphanage spread in all directions for two to three kilometers, and they could walk for a while. They had passed the fence; they had passed the stumps; they had passed the small clearing; ten more minutes of idle remarks and wandering before they came to the small reservoir for the orphanage. Madam Yu stopped Fay by her side and turned around for those words, "I need to send you away."</p>
<p>Iris didn't know how to express the shock, surprise, uncertainty, dismay, and fear brewing inside her, so she kept quiet. Others, especially a boy and Rubik, couldn't show much restraint. Anne was on the verge of tears. Madam Yu waited for the outbursts to pass, and explained how it was the only logical solution to the supply shortage problem. It was mutually beneficial: they would start a life outside the shadows of war, and the orphanage would be able to last a while longer. The seven of them also had a task: find a new location for the orphanage overseas. Group by group, Madam Yu would send the rest of the orphans out of the war zone, too.</p>
<p>Iris couldn't argue even if there wasn't a task involved. She wasn't the type to fight back, and already her mind was convincing herself not to argue: Madam Yu didn't make rash decisions, and the plan must have been in discussion for months; she would also not make any decision that would do them harm; obtaining the documents and passes from the military had taken much of her efforts and money; the seven of them---all between 16 to 18---were indeed the best candidates for this; travel expenses and large living allowances were prepared for each of them, and one of Madam Yu's friends were to receive them at the port on the other side, so it'd be all fine; they'd be together, still; they'd have no wars to worry about...</p>
<p>"Wen Gong---" That was her valet, "---will drive you to the coast and see you off. I'm very sorry that I cannot accompany you." Her expression softened and she spread her arms. "Let's at least make this last month memorable."</p>
<p>Sitting in the chair was no different from standing under the black boughs yesterday. It was gloomy, and though Iris was dressed for cold, she felt otherwise. Anne and one of the boys had not been happy to hear this. Anne went as far as to kneel down and beg Madam Yu to swap her place with Camilla. Madam Yu wasn't moved. The boy was furious that they weren't consulted beforehand, but Iris could understand: the Matron had left them out to avoid changing her mind. She had a soft heart, but she was still a business woman. She knew better than anyone about risks and logic- (and profit-) based decision-making. There were decisions that cannot involve sentiments. It was why she had to keep the head chef, even after all the rumors of what he had done to Cam. They were both irreplaceable here. Cam, who was also Madam Yu's pride, who inherited this mentality of hers (maybe except with fussing over Iris; Iris gave a slight pout at this: what could she do about it), was even said to take over the orphanage if mishap befell Madam Yu. Every plan made by the Matron was the result of careful calculation, and her will was as adamant as her heart was kind and loving. Any resistance, like resisting the war, was already lost before it had even started.</p>
<p>Fay was enthusiastic, though: one of the three. A new life with no war was all she ever wanted, as she had told Iris last night, before turning in. <em>Did she ever go to other girls' rooms for these night chats?</em> Iris wondered as she sat there, reminiscing. <em>Or boys'?</em> Like Rubik, Fay loved to talk. Unlike Rubik, she had more sense and tact. Iris could see her thin eyes compressing into even thinner lines again.</p>
<p>"I'm getting glasses the first thing I get there. I can finally see better. And look better." Fay added in an afterthought. She had lain outside Iris' sheets, holding onto Iris like holding onto a doll. Iris could count her eyelashes. "Think about it, a new life, the best New Year present mum can give us." That was true. At least Madam Yu had waited after the Spring Festival, or the rare feast they had would've been ruined.</p>
<p>"You should tell Anne. To cheer her up."</p>
<p>"She has nothing to look forward to. But <em>you</em> do. Think for me, one word: <em>Rubik</em>." Fay rolled off Iris' bed and left with a sly grin.</p>
<p>It had tickled Iris then as it tickled her now. There was a glimmer of hope in leaving for overseas. Rubik and her wouldn't need to hide the fact that they were even closer than what the adults thought anymore. They could live together, find jobs together, get married, and start a family (Iris' heart raced), a new life. They'd rent a separate place from others, nothing fancy, just enough to be made cozy. They'd work as a maid and a cook to save up some more money (<em>Had to get that thing flowing; can't count on the allowance forever</em>), and hopefully there wouldn't be a creep as the head chef. Then they'd find a better home. She might even be able to apply to college---that <em>did</em> sound nice. She'd become a teacher and teach literature. Of course, they'd find a new place for the orphanage at the same time. Shouldn't forget that...</p>
<p>Outside, snow climbed the glass panel, stepping on top of each other from the window frame. Inside, the room was just warm enough. Madam Yu had allowed the butler to chop down trees in the woods for firewood. Coal and gas were confiscated at the city border. The armies were ruining everyone's lives. Darkness fell and Iris let it fall. The power station had been bombed weeks ago. Thanks to the haze, daylight wasn't enough for the solar panels anymore. They needed to be frugal with electricity. Iris didn't need light anyways.</p>
<p>The war was ruining everything. Iris hated both armies for it. How lucky would it be to grow up in a peaceful place, where wars would never exist. Even when overseas, they wouldn't be immune. What if that country erupted its own civil war?</p>
<p>Darkness fell completely, choking her. Her stomach growled. More watery porridge today. Maybe when spring comes, they'd start harvesting fast-growing vegetables... People were hungry, and Iris feared some of the younger orphans like Timmy would starve to death. That grotesque image refused to leave her mind.</p>
<p>An orange glow grew from the doorway. It emerged and threw the room into a flickering light. Iris gasped and was dazed for a spell. Bit by bit, her room came back to her: the paintings she drew of Anne and Fay on the pale yellow wall, the sepia photo of her in Madam Yu's arms on her sixteenth birthday on the desk, the dried-up twig of orchid from Timmy stuck in a glass of water nearby, and the austere wire-framed mirror beside that, reflecting her tidy bed and her stuffed bunny, her first birthday present from Camilla. Then Rubik's familiar thin face blocked it all. He looked concerned. <em>Oh, he shaved his chin for the first time.</em> Iris thought.</p>
<p>"Iris, dinner. You alright?"</p>
<p>She was gripping the edge of her desk, nails digging into the wood. She rounded on him, grabbed him, and pulled him down to her. Rubik narrowly avoided spilling his makeshift oil lamp. He set it down on the desk with a <em>clang</em>, and fell into the margins of her chair.</p>
<p>Iris understood why Anne was so reluctant to leave, because she felt the same. Of course she also understood why she had to leave, but couldn't make peace between the two. As she sat there, her head buried in Rubik's shoulder, all of the conflicting emotions she had suppressed since hearing the news erupted. Iris couldn't remember the last time she had cried. She had to act strong for the younger orphans for too long. Crying didn't solve problems, but at least it could make her feel better.</p>
<p>Rubik didn't need to ask to know everything, she was sure. He returned her pressure. For once he was serious in these intimacies. He stroked her hair, not before reaching over and kicking the door shut.</p>
<p>"We still have a month. We have time for goodbyes." Rubik murmured. "We'll be fine out there. Fay says Japan is just like here before the war." Iris tried to stem her tears, but all she could manage was howl harder. "They didn't change their language after independence from the Brits, either. We'll be fine.</p>
<p>"You know what mum tells me? The ship we're boarding is as huge as this mansion. Aren't you excited to see it? How does it even float on water? Iris, we'll see it together. We'll walk up and down that thing until we're too tired to walk, just like we did when mum first took us in. Iris? C'mon, Iris. Mum says we'll be comfortable during the trip. She got us first class rooms. She says it's called a 'cabin'."</p>
<p>Rubik become louder and louder. He was trying to cheer her up by doing what he did the best. <em>He's hopeless.</em> Iris thought. <em>Just shut up and hold me.</em></p>
<p>"You know what her friend does? <em>Literature professor.</em> A critic, but also a professor. Mum put in a good word for you! They were really close before she fled there from the war. They were dorm mates in school! She'll probably just take you in as her student. I'm no good with school, but do tell me what happens when you come home every day, yeah?"</p>
<p>It did sound wonderful. Maybe she'd apply as soon as she could. Iris quieted down to just sobs. Rubik kept talking, stroking her hair.</p>
<p>"You think we'll be able to live alone? The seven of us don't have to live together, do we? We have our own money. No need to hide our thing anymore, either, I reckon. No more grown-ups around. Why did we hide it in the first place, again? It's your idea."</p>
<p>Iris didn't reply. Rubik always had a minty scent. She nuzzled him to get more. She'd wash the smeared shirt for him later.</p>
<p>"I think I'll find a job, though. You go to your classes and I'll see if we can keep the money flowing. Can't just sit on mum's allowance. Maybe I'll be an apprentice to the swordsmiths. They make damn good swords there, I've heard. You've seen the armoury down in the east wing, but bet you don't know half the swords there are Made in Japan <em>TM</em>. Then I might open my own---"</p>
<p>"Rubik."</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>"If we ever have a child---"</p>
<p>"It'll be a girl, look like you, and capricious like me. Probably." Rubik said without thinking. They'd went through this too many times. "Maybe call her Lily or something. Can never have too many flowers, you know."</p>
<p>"That's new."</p>
<p>"Uprooting the flower patch was traumatizing."</p>
<p>"Trauma<em>tic</em>."</p>
<p>Rubik snorted, and kissed her hair.</p>
<p>"Dinner?"</p>
<p>Iris wanted to stay a bit longer. It was as if they were back on the hilltop.</p>
